This is currently shown to all guests when they get to this stage.  It\'s up to you if you want this to happen (particularly when you have active \'minimum prices\' in play - that looks a bit odd).You could leave it as is, with the idea that you\'ll start to phase out minimum prices.  Or leave as is and report \'minimum price\' cases differently.  Or only show when for admin users (so if you went to the booking you\'d be able to see it, but the normal guest wouldn\'t).2. The font is vaguely intended to suggest a till roll, but of course all font/colour stuff can be fixed to suit.3. This price report will also be available in the admin pages for any booking with a generated price report.  So if you create a fake booking on beta and go to it in the admin pages you will see the report.4. To generate the report I\'ve changed the price generation process, so I\'m generally testing to make sure the prices still match the live site.5.

So we could start by saying \"Price for 6 nights from 27 July to 4 August is [e.g.] £700.00\" as a statement and then, minus \"10% Two-person discount £70.00\", minus 5% blah blah discount £35.00\" making £695.00 (or suchlike). That would avoid having to report  per night prices and then add them together, and would avoid cross-season calculations (all done in the background to give the £700.00 price).This would suit the main purpose of the price report mechanism which is to give a base price and then say what the guest is getting taken off (or added on).Martin","No image","No file"

Could we summarize just with a catch all \"Discount\" and omit any detail. It\'s particularly distracting when it crosses over seasons and may just confuse guests. If they ask for a breakdown of the discounts, we can manually go to the admin page and write an email reply to the guest with a summary (i.e. say that it\'s a £57.50 low-occupancy discount, or a £x.xx late-booking discount). For \"Surcharge\" (if amount is not negative), this would be listed as \"Surcharge\", and at present the freeflow text about extra cost for sofabed linen, etc. would be displayed in any case on this page, therefore giving an explanation for any surcharge amounts.So, the guest may see for example:2 guests (2 adults and no children), arriving Wednesday 10 July 2013 for 7 nights.Departing Wednesday 17 July 2013.Full price£575.00Discount-£57.50Total price for this booking £517.50 And then, in future, if we have additional items, they could be listed in a \'till roll\' type manner, for example, as:2 guests (2 adults and no children), arriving Wednesday 10 July 2013 for 7 nights.Departing Wednesday 17 July 2013.Full price£575.00Discount-£57.50Travel cot/high chair-£0.00Chocolates-£15.00Total price for this booking £532.50","No image","No file"

I guess that at a key holiday time (e.g. Christmas/New Year) we might want to alter this to 7 days, but even then we would usually arrange to have someone ""on the ground"" who could meet late-arriving guests if necessary. So, if I remember correctly:after the Late-Booking Cut-Offs (<3 days), the booking would go through to the ""Enquire about these dates (we need to check with the owner)"" option; for 3-7 days (UK) or 3-14 days (int), 100% payment would be taken with an email saying that we'll meet on arrival (specific wording to be confirmed);for 7-n days (UK) and 14-n days (int), 100% payment would be taken with an email saying that keys will be posted (specific wording to be confirmed);for >n days, deposit payment is taken (see sep bugnote re. %age), with balance due by specified date.I think we agreed that n is 35 or 42 days (can't remember the precise value). Hope that's clear!Martin","No image","No file"

The Transaction is refused due to bad authn/authz.E. The Webserver is unable to complete the Transaction F. The Webserver is unable to move the booking into a state of Confirmed (though the money has been taken)G. The Webserver successfully completes the payment process.How To Handle Each Case===============================================================================A. ""Transaction cannot be created""-------------------------------------------------------------------------------No money has changed hands, no paypal authn/authz has taken place.  Return an error page telling the visitor that the payment could not be paid....And then what?The user probably wants to try again.  But there's no good reason why we failed before, so why would it work now?  Timeout, perhaps.  Give the user a button (paypal express checkout button) to try again.  Also give them a link to contact VRS directly.  Meanwhile, send an email to VRS telling them that an attempted payment failed.Result: The booking has been left in 'accepted' and must be manually completed or removed.  Same as currently.  Actually, I should move the booking down to Cancelled.  If they click the button to try again, immediately move it back to Accepted.  [And we may not be able to, so will have to catch that case].If a Payment has been created then cancel it.B. ""Visitor never comes back""-------------------------------------------------------------------------------At the moment, nothing I can do about this.  The booking is left in 'Accepted'  but no emails have been sent out.  VRS will have to check manually.  But they won't know they have to do so.So, I _could_ send an email when the booking is accepted, saying that there should be a payment along soon.Or, I _could_ set up a recurring task (every 24 hours, say) which will remove any 'Accepted' booking that hasn't been converted to 'Confirmed'.  It would have to be actually tracking down 'in transit' 'deposit' Payments.  So a Payment needs a 'last state changed' field, so I can find 'deposit' payments whose state is 'in-transit' and hasn't changed for say an hour.  Then the tracker would go from the payment to the booking, cancel the Payment and cancel the booking.Obviously the former is simplest and the latter is best.  I think the former is good enough to continue with.So, add a step - 2.5 above - ""new Email sent to VRS""C. ""Transaction authn/authz fails due to PayPal problem""-------------------------------------------------------------------------------This is unlikely but possible.  No money has been exchanged.  I think same response as (A)D. ""Transaction authn/authz refused""-------------------------------------------------------------------------------PayPal has declined the transaction.  What should I do?  I think same response as (A)E. ""Webserver is unable to complete the Transaction""-------------------------------------------------------------------------------Authn/Authz has completed but no money has been taken.  Same response as (A)F. ""Payment taken, but booking cannot be moved to Confirmed""-------------------------------------------------------------------------------This absolutely shouldn't happen.  If it does, email the VISITOR and VRS immediately, telling them help is on its way.  Leave the booking as 'Accepted'.  Tell the visitor not to try again.G. ""The webserver completes the payment and booking process""-------------------------------------------------------------------------------Thought I'd never get here.  I think in this version I don't have all the details needed to send the 'full' deposit taken email.  May need to send a variation.  Send email to Visitor and Vrs.","No image","No file"

This is just FYI: it's a pretty basic system and has no online payment integration (a few weeks ago I asked if that is imminent but it isn't!).  We offer this to guests from Europe only (because they offer only certain currencies, mainly EU ones, and don't yet do USD). The guest has to manually make the payment and it takes a day or two to reach us (so this would count as one of the options that knocks back to not being a fully confirmed online booking). However, it's possible to offer customised links... here's the text that we use in our bookings template: TransferWise: Guests travelling from Europe may prefer to use TransferWise (http://transferwise.com), which often has cheaper rates than using an international bank transfer. This is a fully securely encrypted system. Please click here for a customised invoice so that you can pay the amount of £400.00 (if you prefer to pay the full amount of £100.00 now, then here’s a link for that option).http://transferwise.com/pay/8557324b?reference=VRSA00000tmp&tcurrencyamt=400.00&payername=Test%20Guest&payeremail=test@mmps.co.uk http://transferwise.com/pay/8557324b?reference=VRSA00000tmp&tcurrencyamt=100.00&payername=Test%20Guest&payeremail=test@mmps.co.uk  Cheers Martin","No image","No file"

In general I wouldn't usually make that change: I'd either delete a CLOSED date or UNKNOWN date but not change its status. Ewan or Belinda wouldn't usually be making these changes any way. Having said that, it's amazing what small things one doesn't remember so I can't guarantee it. Anyway, I guess I'm saying that we can assume this is the only one. Also, I'm happy to keep 28th blocked at Broompark: the owner just didn't want a same-day changeover and having it blocked means that there will be a day's gap. We're v close to that date now, and prob won't get a Hogmanay booking for Broompark anyway. So, in that case, it's probably ok not to release the update until we're ready with the online booking, which I think is quite close to being released in it's first version anyway. Just thought I'd offer those two solutions in case this helps you in deciding what remedies to put in place. CheersMartin","No image","No file"

I spotted this in the availability database, and not sure if these guests meant to confirm their booking (they had sent an email request from TripAdvisor for those dates), or if they simply aborted. I'm perfectly happy to deal with these cases manually, and I can choose one of two ways:(1) email them to say ""would you still like to confirm this""(2) just go ahead with our usual confirmation email asking for payment, and then they can say ""* off, we don't need it now, thank you"" if that's what they are thinking. I'll plump for (2) in this case because I think they may have wanted the booking.  Anyway, this is a long-winded way of saying that it would be useful to have the IN_PROGRESS cases appear in the daily tickets report, so that I know to pick them up. Also, could each booking have a ""date/time originally created"" note in an audit log or suchlike so that we know when a guest created the booking?ThanksMartin","No image","No file"

Guest creates booking with manual payment request2. Booking is in 'ACCEPTED' mode3. Martin visits the booking page4. Spreadsheet data is generated with blank for column AJ5. Martin takes payment manually by bank transfer and moves booking to CONFIRMED6. Now, the spreadsheet data will say 'PayPal Payment' ! So I don't think I can use just the booking state.   What I could do is look for actual Payments. Currently we only have one point where a Payment is created, and that's the deposit, and it's always PayPal.  So for each booking I could look and see if I have a completed Payment attached to the booking.  If I do, then I can write in 'PayPal Payment', otherwise it would be blank. This does mean that if you manually take a PayPal payment the system won't know.  Later on we should look at allowing you to add details of manually-taken payments to the booking.    So, given that this is going to be right more often, but still wrong occasionally, which would be your preferred option?  (Which would be least confusing?) cheers,Alastair  ","No image","No file"

Would you be able to set this date to be ""ArrivalDate - 6 weeks"" since we use that date as an alert that we need to request a balancing payment straightaway if the booking starts within that 6-week period. You've not missed anything... it's just that I'm a bit fickle about these cut-off dates and have different criteria at different times! We tend to be quite conservative when doing manual bookings that are far in advance (25% now and balance 6 weeks ahead, and that gives time to chase any missed balancing payments before sending the keys out). This means that in theory if a booking is <6 weeks ahead we should take the 100% payment. But in practice we have a grey area between 3 weeks and 6 weeks (int bookings) and between 1-2 weeks and 6 weeks (national bookings). Within that time period we tend to make a judgment as to whether to ask for full amount straighaway or whether to take the 25% deposit and then ask for the balance (reasoning is that we don't want to put guests off by demanding the full amount). I know that for the app system we have to be precise about this info, and at present the cut-off is set at 3 weeks. From our experience since going live, guests appear to be quite confident about making the PayPal payments (not many abandoned bookings and, if there is one, then it is sometimes followed by a confirmed one). I may therefore ask you to move the cut-off date from 3 weeks to 4 weeks shortly (and then to 5 weeks a while after that), i.e. once the online payment system is well bedded in.  Sorry for all of this confusion, but I think it will all settle down in coming weeks. I think we can keep the cut-off #OfDays as a hard (and not configurable) variable since I think these changes are just during the settling-down phase. Hope this info is clear enough. If not, just shout!CheersMartin  ","No image","No file"

Name Lookup FailedThis is what failed on the 30th October.  A failure is not unheard of, though these days it is very rare.  When it fails, it's out of my control - it's an Internet thing. 2. Name Lookup _Kept_ FailingEither PayPal was unavailable for 6 days (unlikely), or the system kept reporting Name Lookup failures to the VRS app even after the problem went away.  I'm looking at this - again, it's not part of the VRS app, but I perhaps have a little control over the settings.  However the default settings suggest that it should have tried again after ten seconds, instead of holding on to the failure. 3. Don't Abort for Name Lookup FailuresReally, there's no reason for me to abort the booking for a name lookup.  It's rare, but there's every chance that normally it would come back again. 4. Report Internal ErrorsIf there is an internal error serving up a web page then I get an email report.  In this case, the internal error was in the middle of the payment process.  We work very hard to stop any error escaping out of the payment process, and because of that the error was not reported.  Obviously I have to report the error even if I catch it. 5.

I'll keep checking, and I'll let you now if and when I see any payments going through.  I suspect that everything will now ""just work"" and in the future we'll have proper reporting in case of problems. cheers,Alastair","No image","No file"

Support G5 Root CertificateWhen we connect to PayPal, we need to insist they present credentials signed using a G5 root certificate.  (previously we only needed to insist on G2). When connecting, we use the default certificate store baked into the version of Java we are running.  (Currently v1.7.0_71-b14).  According to the PayPal docs, we need to ""check your keystore for the presence of the G5 Root Certificate"". I did this using this command: keytool -keystore ""$JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/security/cacerts"" -storepass changeit -list This results in a long list of installed certificates.  Amongst them is ""verisignclass3g5ca"", i.e. the G5 root certificate.  The list includes a 'fingerprint' for the certificate which I've confirmed against the PayPal docs. We also contain the G2 root certificate (""verisignclass3g2ca"").  However my understanding from the doc is that, so long as we contain the more advanced root cert, we will be ok.  We only need to ensure that we have the new root cert.  2. Use SHA-256 Signing Algorithm Again, we use the algorithms baked into Java, and during connections the strongest algorithm is used.  SHA-256 is supported by our current version of Java, so this should be ok.  So: I'll keep an eye out, but my investigation suggests that we are already ready for the update.  This is reasonable, since security algorithms tend to be 'out there' for several years before they become mandatory, in order to allow everyone to catch up. cheers,Alastair ","No image","No file"

The Booking's Operative fields are left empty when it is created, and this means ""Use the Organisation defaults""or2. The Booking's Operative fields are set when it is created, copied from the Organisation.The difference here is that if you change the Organisation default greeter, then with method #1 all bookings - past, present and future - will assume that they're the responsibility of the new greeter.  But with method #2 all the _old_ bookings will be the responsibility of the old greeter, and the _new_ bookings will be down to the new greeter.Does that make sense?  If so, which approach would you prefer? 1. #1 is probably simpler2. #2 may lead to fewer 'surprising changes'3. With #2, if you then later the booking's Greeter to empty, that really does mean ""No one is assigned to this yet""4. With #1, you'd get the same effect by having a special ""Nobody"" operative5. With #2, we'll need to work out how to migrate the existing bookings to use the right operatives6. With #1, we'll just assume the existing bookings used/are using/are going to use the default operatives(You will also be able to override these settings on a per-booking basis of course.  And in fact once the task is 'complete' the booking will have a record of that, and who carried out the task, so at that point it will be set in stone). I'm tending towards #1 myself, just because it's simpler to implement, but I wanted to check what you thought. cheers,Alastair What sh","No image","No file"

Organisation Org1 has two cleaners, Fred and Bob 2. The default is Fred 3. A guest confirms a booking and a Cleaning task is assigned to Fred  If we left the booking entry blank, and then later changed the default to Bob, then we'd have an odd situation that says: 1. ""This booking's cleaning is the responsibility of the default cleaner, Bob"" 2. ""But the cleaning task for this booking is assigned to Fred"" ...which makes no sense.  So I think the booking starts with no operative set, but as soon as we raise Tasks (i.e. as soon as the booking gets confirmed) we should set the Operatives on the booking.  If the organisation defaults change after that, the booking carries on using the values it had when its Tasks were created. Of course at a later point the Manager can change these; at which point we would, presumably, cancel the old Task and raise a new one for the new Operative. cheers,Alastair","No image","No file"

""Bookings Only"" vs. ""Full Management"" Ok, I'll add a flag to the organisation to describe the management services VRS carries out for it.  2. VRS 'Groups' So, I understand that you've split the properties up into groups.  The problem is, users - and therefore, operatives - belong to a single organisation. So where you have the same user - WishyWashy - doing the cleaning for four organisations, that wouldn't be possible.   I can think of a few ways around this:  1. We could create multiple users: i.e. ""wishywashy_ania"", ""wishywashy_ester"", ""wishywashy_nomsa"", ""wishywashy_vrs"".  They would each eventually have their own calendar. This would work, but would be a bit of a faff for the site and the operatives. Estimate: 0   2. We could allow you to set defaults on a per-property basis ...with a 'fallback' option, so if there wasn't a cleaner set for a property then the property would use the organisation's value.  In this case these ""sub-organisations"" would all be merged back into one, VRS. This would work pretty well; but you wouldn't be able to see a list of the properties in each sub-organisation.  (actually, presumably that's the case already?). Estimate: 1/2 hours   3. We could allow you to set up _groups_ within an organisation. This would formalise the arrangement you're getting into already - VRS is split into four organisational groups.  A user might have a default group, but would be visible across all the groups in an organisation. This would let you see, for example, all the properties in Ania's group, in a summary. To support this, I'd have to set up some new pages for you to create and manage the groups, so it would be more work. Estimate: 1d  (Please note: all the estimates are a bit rough and ready, just enough to give you a sense of scale). I did consider allowing users to be in more than one organisation, but it's really not a good idea and would make permissions very tricky.  So: what do you want me to do?  cheers,Alastair","No image","No file"

In this case, WishyWashy is an exception and in fact the current structure of how we work with WishyWashy means that WishyWashy_Ennis is different conceptually from WishyWashy_VRS: Ennis pays WW directly, for instance, and VRS pays WW separately for all other properties... but, unusually for non-VRS organisations, I report dates to WW for cleaning and laundry (incidentally, you'll note that WW is the cleaner too for Ennis/AT10). So, I think that this is a genuine case where WW can have two separate calendars.  I'd not want to make WW universal, because we don't need WW to appear on other properties where we carry out a ""bookings only"" service. >> I could extend the user so that as well as a 'home' organisation, they have a list of >> organisations who can use them.  So we could say, for example, that WishyWashy >> belongs to the VRS organisation, but can be used by VRS _and_ Ennis. This is also a good solution and would sort out the WW issue in the current example, but the more I think about it, the more I think that WW_Ennis and WW_VRS are genuinely separate entities. This is principally because of the fact that the billing from WW is separate. For example, at present Holligan is ""bookings only"" so we'll not add cleaning/laundry info in their calendar, but in future Holligan might say ""I use cleaner A and laundry B"" and we might say ""we can provide a calendar for these services so please give me their names and contact details"". We'd then switch Holligan to ""full property management"" but the calendars and management would be separate from VRS, because Holligan still manage and pay cleaner A and laundry B independently of VRS. If laundry B happens to be WW, then it's still correct that they have a separate calendar because the billing is separate. However, if Holligan had asked VRS to provide a cleaner and laundry service, then we would change SHP's organisation from Holligan to VRS because SHP then comes under a different umbrella. Ditto if Ennis asks VRS to switch from doing bookings only to doing full property management for AT10. WW will therefore have a VRS calendar and an Ennis/AT10 calendar, which reflects the way that they invoice VRS and Ennis at the end of each month. Hope this helpsMartin","No image","No file"

We'd like to be able to copy 2016 seasons wholesale to 2017 (& then adjust for Easter, etc), or have a 1 or more templates for 2017, 2018, etc (with Easter dates, etc in place) that we can use to update each property, perhaps by having a dropdown menu to select seasons for e.g. 2017 for a property that then get populated automatically. At present we have to manually add in all spans for each property. So there's a lot of repetition.  While I play with the cal entries, would you be able to work on this CR so that we can update calendars on the VRS app more efficiently? In the main, most properties use the same seasons; some are customised to the owner's requirements. Could you think about how best to copy calendars across... maybe setting it up property by property, or perhaps by groups of properties, which would mean e.g. selecting template_cal1_2017 for a number of properties (perhaps with a list of properties and a tick-box beside each to select and then apply the template to those properties).

Cookies on the website:Correct, we don't use cookies normally (we do if you log in, since that's how we keep track of your login token).   We could use them to track, but... we already use google analytics, and that should give you all the information you need - am I right?More likely, we might use cookies to remember users' ""recently viewed"" properties.  In that case yes, we'd need a warning, and perhaps a way to continue without them.  If you'd like this, just raise a CR for it.  2. Webfaction dataYes, your webfaction server is in the US.  However they have datacentres in Europe too (Amsterdam and London) so if that was an issue then we can get your server migrated - just raise a CR for it.  3. Privacy Policy LinkI think this has all been handled now by a later CR.  4. Admin privacy-policy pageThis has been handled - your privacy policy text is in the Site admin page, here: https://vrs.nmbeta.com/admin/site/  5. Do we need a combined Terms/Privacy Policy?I don't think so, myself.  You have a 'Terms' document for each property, so I think that would be enough.  The only thing I can think of is that you might want to say that people can only use the data for personal reasons unless agreed (so a third-party site can't use your search).  But that seems a bit unlikely to me.  However, it's not a problem if you want one.  Or I can just rename the 'privacy' link to say 'terms / privacy' and you can put both pieces of text together.    6. Text for /contact and /long-staysCorrect, both those pieces of text are hard-coded.  If you'd like them to be configurable then just let me know (raise it as a separate CR); it would be pretty simple to implement. cheers,Alastair","No image","No file"

Because we store guests' info, it's good practice to have a privacy policy to confirm to guests what we do with their data, i.e. use the data to administer their booking, don't pass info to 3rd parties (except to request a TripAdvisor, etc. review), may email after their stay with info about VRS (at present this is just in the form or a seasonal greeting in December, but potentially could extend to other ""marketing messages"", etc.) Some questions:= I see that many privacy policies include info about cookies. I don't think we use cookies on the VRS app, so no need to mention these at present. However, would it be worth using cookies so that we can review the ""customer journey"" on our site (e.g. see how many properties someone view, see how often they go back and forth between property page and calendar before booking, etc.)? Not crucial info at present, but could be useful for analysis. What do you think and do any particular pros/cons spring to mind? I know that we'd have to include an alert to users of our site that cookies are being used and possibly to give them the option of proceeding without cookies.= I know that all data on the VRS app is encrypted and secure.

As I mentioned before, we always prepare a property after a booking, but there are times when an additional clean/service is needed prior to the start of a booking. For ""first bookings of the season"", we do a pre-start-of-season clean, and would set that to be on the day of the first arrival (or possibly bring it forward by a few days), or on the day that the flat becomes free for bookings. We add these in manually as additional, extra cleans (and sometimes it's a deep clean, rather than the standard service clean; that would be included in the notes for that clean). Similarly if there is a gap of some weeks between bookings, we would add in a refresh clean.So, I guess that this is an additional task to add in, and perhaps we could have an option of creating a ""pre-clean"" for properties (e.g. ones that come onto the books for the first time, ones that come on for the summer season, ones where there's been a gap). Where to attach the special request if there's not a previous booking? I guess that the best place would be arrive day of the booking that has the special request. Although even if it's set on that day, it would be good to have an alert a few days before (in case special arrangements are needed that take time to put in place); in googleCal I would add the task into the calendar, and set an alert for n days before.     Key Box Date  > You've said the due date should be the key-send date - is that right?  In international> cases that would mean three weeks before the guests arrive.  It's quite possible for there> to be another booking between the date you set up the box and the date your guests arrive...I was thinking that the property owner/manager needs to email the guest with the info ahead of their arrival, so that that have the info in hand.

Special Requests - Scanning Ahead4. Special Requests - no previous booking 2. Special Requests - Scanning AheadI see what you mean about scanning ahead. And, yes, if an intervening booking is cancelled then the task would need to be adjusted to the previous booking's departure date. Here's a stab at an alternative procedure where special requests are set for arrival day at time of booking. They stay there until nearer the start of the booking. Could you ""scan ahead"" each day but only look 10 days ahead, and then adjust any special reqeusts at that time? By this time a cancellation is unlikely, and there are fewer late bookings:1. set all special requests for arrival day (i.e. the lastest day by which they are to be done).2. each day, scan for the coming Z days (where e.g. Z = 10)3. if there's a special request, see if there's a departure (and therefore a SERVICE) at that property within the next Z days; if so, attach the special request to that date4. if no service with Z days, treat as ""special request - no previous booking"" as below5. Let's set Z = 10, but with a view to being able to raise a CR to change this to 7 or another number of days if we find it would make for smoother running of things if it were changed.6. Also, I guess that provision would still be needed to re-adjust tasks in case of cancellation or in case of a late booking 4. Special Requests - no previous bookingLet's set X to be Z (as above) (i.e. I think that 10 is a reasonable value) and raise a SPECIAL_REQUEST_ALERT at X, and Y will be arrival day, becuase the manager will confirm that the SPECIAL_REQUEST can be actioned by the cleaner on the arrival day, at the latest, or can manually change the SPECIAL_REQUEST date (e.g. if cleaner will be at a nearby property for a serivce on the day before special request is required) Does this discussion help?!Martin","No image","No file"

So, yes that prinicple is ok.PreArrivalFreshen: Your proposal is good, i.e. (1) set the task to be 10 days before a booking; (2) set the task when creating a booking (unless there's another booking in between, in which case the task is not required); (3) if another booking is inserted and the task becomes obsolete, then remove the task. Forget my comment about cleaner needing 5 days notice: this task will already be in the cal so that ""notice period"" is not relevant; also, once the task lists are up and running then we'll all be checking out calendars daily so the ""notice period"" is a red herring.  Milk note: Yes, showing the next booking's arrival date on the Service task is correct. Then the cleaner can make a judgement about milk, etc. So, ignore the Milk note task! (Background info: the cleaner puts in a pint of milk whenever they go to service a property, so that it's there for the next booking. If the cleaners know how many days it is till the next booking, then they can check the milk ""sell by"" date and decide whether or not to leave it in the fridge.) Phew... yes, lots of questions, but this seems to be shaking down ok. We're getting there, and I very much appreciate your lucid reinterpretation of my notes. So, starting with the straightforward tasks is obviously sensible, and we can sort out the more complex ones later. CheersMartin ","No image","No file"

Please meet guest at about <arrival time[need this as new field, and we usually set this to me 60  mins after flight arrival time or 30 mins after train arrival time]: <first_name> <surname> <mob#>; arriving on <flight number> into Edinburgh at <flight/train arrival time>. <VRSAnnnnn>  Just to be clear about what info goes where: 1. The Task has a TITLE - a short (one line) description of the task2. The Task has some NOTES - a short-ish (two/three lines) summary3. There is the TASK PAGE - that's the page the operative can go to to see all the relevant details.  Now - in your blurb above, did you mean for that info to go into the NOTES or the TASK PAGE?  The computer almost certainly won't know the arrival details when it creates the task.  It's definitely something a human will have to enter.  The arrival fields are all optional and the arrival time notes field is up to the guest - they could say ""3:30pm"", or ""sometime in the afternoon, around four-ish unless something comes up"". So you should assume the normal process is: 1. Booking gets created2. Task gets created3. Operative / Manager updates the arrival info4. Something Happens If your blurb goes in the TASK PAGE, then when the operative goes to the page I'll show the latest details.  If you update the arrival details then the next time they visit the page, the details will be up to date. But If this is to go into the task notes, then I will have to update the task any time you make any changes to the arrival fields.  Which is fine, but it's an extra thing to do.  I think what we'd agreed was that the task would have the bare bones and would link back to the task page, where there would be the full details and which would always be up to date. So... is this what you think?  Or have I misunderstood? cheers,Alastair p.s. I don't think we need a new Arrival Time field, as we already have an 'Arrival Time Notes' field?","No image","No file"

However should priority be given to returning the actual dates requested if they are available?So, say for example a guest requests 9 nights from 10/2/11-19/2/11 (using the same example as before), with a wriggle of 2 days. If the price for 8-19/2 is the same as the price for 9-20/2, 10-19/2 or 12-21/2/11, then which of those dates would it return? Presumably the exact 10-19/2 match would be prioritised, even though 8-17/2/11 and 12-21/2/11 are available too. And then, on checking availability, the guest can see at a glance if the 2 days before and after are available. However, in example search of 22Dec details below, it offered 8-17/2/11 as \'default\'. Perhaps this issue will be resolved at a later stage:We also discussed (for a later stage) possibly giving two sets of results: a listing of \"Exact dates\" and prices for properties available, followed by a header \"Alternative dates\" or suchlike with any properties available within 2 days of the exact search. Let\'s talk about this next week if any of the above is not very clear.","No image","No file"

If the correct reference is VRSA56849, then just change the entry in the spreadsheet.  2. If the reference really _has_ changed from VRSA56849 to VRS0248 then you need to cancel the previous entry.  Add a row for VRSA56849 with a status of \'cancelled\' (it needs to have valid information in every field, so the easiest thing to do is just copy the VRS0248 row, set its ref to VRSA56849 and set its status to \'cancelled\'.cheers,Alastair","No image","No file"

However, there is a problem with the search:(1) At \"Browse our properties\" on the home page, I asked for 5 guests in Edinburgh, and it returns the correct properties, plus all non-Edinburgh properties. Ditto if other locations are selected, so I think that the \"Location\" drop-down is not working, so this bug needs ironing out. See, e.g., this link http://vacation-rentals-scotland.com/search/?location=perthshire_angus&guests=5&rating=Any(2) Maybe the best change would be to put the \"Your search\" box on the home page, i.e. the search box that appears to the right on the page http://vacation-rentals-scotland.com/search/?location=perthshire_angus&guests=5&rating=Any. This is the same box, but also includes option to put in dates if guest knows required dates.(3) Point 2 would then mean that \"Or why not search for a property\" is redundant.Is the above change straightforward enough to implement? If not, then need to fix the bug at (1) and change \"Or why not search for a property\" to reach \"Or if you know when you\'d like to stay, click here to search for a property\".Martin","No image","No file"

Here are some comments:I see that only Saturday dates are in bold-face, and these are the only dates that can be clicked on for prices. Not sure how/whether to express this in the legend (e.g. Available --> Available start date for green, and change non-Sats to a different shade of green, but that would overcomplicate the calendar). I vaguely recall that some bookings sites put a colour tag on the start days.Another place to add the info that you can start only on Sats  (or, e.g., Fri) would be in the instruction sentence above the calendar, e.g.:Click on the calendar below to choose your arrival date.-->Click on the calendar below to choose your arrival date (Saturdays only for this property)Just throwing out a coulpe ideas here since I\'m not sure which elements are more straightforward to change in order to give a different feel to the calendar for \"whole weeks only\" properties.

Basically CR requests should change the booking status to \"Requested\", and Book Now (BN) requests should change the booking status to \"Accepted\".For CR, the behaviour should therefore be the same as the current Book Now (BN) option, although as discussed the wording of the confirmation emails will change slightly. The status of the booking will therefore be \"Requested\", and the dates are therefore still open for other potential guests to enquire under the CR option. For the Book Now (BN) option, the status should be changed to \"Accepted\" so that no other potential guests can enquire or book. We know that we can confirm those bookings, and in 95% of cases the guests pay their downpayment or full payment within a few days. We therefore don\'t want anyone else enquiring about those dates.In the 5% of cases where we think a BN booking may fall through, we would manually change the booking back from Accepted to Requested, and also apply the CR setting to those dates so that any enquirers get the CR email. The setting would be changed to \"Confirmed\" once payment is received, or \"Cancelled\" if the booking falls through.Does that all tally with your thoughts?Martin","No image","No file"

I agree that we should use the word \"confirmed\" only when referring to the status, so I have updated the wording in the emails using \"accepted\" where relevant. These are the distinctions we draw:Status: Requested: the dates remain green in calendar, a booking conf is requested, but guest gets an alert that we may not be able to confirm. I am emailing you revised wording for the email.Status: Accepted: the dates go to red in the calendar, and it\'s a confirmed/binding booking that we will honour (other than in extreme circumstances of double-bookings in which case we write a grovelling email to the guest). Will email you the wording for the guest email.Status: Confirmed: This is the status when the 25% downpayment/deposit has been made, and is prior to fully paid. These two statuses are not relevant at vrs-phase-2, but for example if a guest were asked immediately to pay the 25% online, and that payment were confirmed, then the status would go directly to Confirmed rather than Accepted.I think I\'ve updated the wording correctly in the emails that will go to guests.

You will see below  that some of the accented characters appear as boxes in the name and address  fields (and the hyperlinks are footnoted!).

I can use the older \'cropping\' approach for the thumbnails.  Each thumbnail will then be in a 4:3 landscape ratio, but the proper picture will be in its correct ratio.2. I use a smarter approach to resizing, where I decide whether the image is either portrait or landscape, and then resize to suit with cropping.  So I say, I\'m going to resize this thumbnail to either 80x60 or 60x80, and if the provided image isn\'t exactly one of those, I\'ll crop to fit as before.3. We do nothing :-)All three of these are quite feasible, but #2 involves a bit more effort.  What do you think?cheers,Alastair","No image","No file"

Many of them seem to have double forward slashes after the domain name (e.g. \'//\').  This would normally suggest a mistake in the redirecting, but I\'ve checked them and they appear to be fine.  It\'s not really a problem - I can have the site correct these addresses (replace the // with /) and send the correct address back as a redirect.2. The \'robots.txt\' is an instruction for search engines, and you don\'t need to worry about it.3. The page names themselves - FAQ.htm, cost.htm, guest.htm etc. - don\'t match up to the new page names.  And in some cases there is no corresponding page - there is no FAQ page any more, for example.4. The slugs for properties don\'t match.  For example, on the old site the King\'s Stables slug was kingsstables, but in the new site it\'s ks.  So the new site doesn\'t know what to do with this alias. So...1. Fixing the // to / is easy.2. Once #1 is fixed, the robots.txt files will work properly3. I can either match these to existing pages or sections, or just dump the visitor on the property page.4. This is the tricky one!You probably don\'t want to change the property slugs back to the old ones - after all, they\'ve been here for a while, there are probably as many links in to these slugs as there are to the old ones.There are some options:a) Set up some permanent redirects via your service provider (was it reg123?), so that e.g. \"http://www.vacation-rentals-scotland.com/kingsstables\" redirects to \"http://www.vacation-rentals-scotland.com/ks\".b) Add an extra field to Properties - \'alternativeSlug\' - which would be accepted as well as the proper slug.  c) Allow admin users to configure permanent redirects via the site.  This would mean adding admin pages to let you manage redirects yourself.  The easiest thing is probably #a, fix this with permanent redirects.  #b is a bit of a sticking plaster - works for this, but we may run up against the problem of \'dead links\' again later.  #c is most future proof but involves more time and work.What do you think?cheers,Alastair","No image","No file"

Javascript 'history back' link This is the simplest approach.  When I draw the property page, I use javascript to insert a link to go back one page.  If the visitor has come from the search page, it goes back to the search page. The problem here is that it will go back one page no matter where the visitor came from.   For example: - Visitor goes to search page, sees results- Visitor selects result, goes to property page- Visitor clicks on a photo and goes to photo gallery page- Visitor clicks on the 'back to the property' link on the photo gallery page- Visitor clicks 'back' on the property page- Visitor is back on the gallery page! This is because the 'back to the property' link on the gallery page is a real link, not just a 'back' step. We can get around this by making sure that all of these links - on the photo gallery, on the calendar, on the booking page - all use the javascript 'history back' link instead of real links.  But we can't guarantee this will always work.  So, it's the simplest, but also most likely to occasionally give odd results.  And of course it doesn't work when javascript is disabled (not that big a deal for a 'nice-to-have' feature like this). 2. Store the search parameters in the session or cookie Sometimes, websites can store a small amount of information in a cookie, sent to the site with every request.  The cookie is a way of remembering things from page to page.   We could use this - with javascript - to remember the search parameters and create a back link. The problem here is that this will fail when the visitor has more than one window or tab open.  The same information will be sent with every request, so when the page is drawn the link won't always be correct.  And the cookie has to be 'populated' on the previous page - so unless you came direct from the search page, this won't work (e.g. if you sent a link to someone, they wouldn't see the back link).3. Store the search parameters in the url We already do this to a limited extent.  The url for the property might be: http://vacation-rentals-scotland.com/properties/cws/?arrive=24/06/2011&month=201106&nights=7&adults=2&children=2 We do this so that we can pass the information on to the next pages - calendar and booking.  We could use these embedded parameters to construct the back link.  The change would be to extend this to cover all the search terms, and to do so even when the visitor is just browsing. This is probably the most correct way of doing things.  It will work when people send the links to each other and doesn't rely on javascript or cookies. The downside with this is that it is more work.  I'd have to replace the existing 'half model' with this one, and I'd have to work out how to cache the property page when the urls are all different, to keep the performance ok under load. So... I'd suggest #1 for simplicity but expect odd results now and then, or #3 to do it right but pay more.  What do you think? cheers,Alastair ","No image","No file"

We\'re therefore now ready for this to go live with the map showing on the front page. I see that the visitor guide and the one property in that area is already up and running. Please could you check the photos, and let me know if any would benefit from being lower res. Ewan put some up, and I think he put hi res versions up. I have adjusted some to low res (and some of these may be a little too small?), but am not sure I have caught all of them.Also, we uploaded some pics to the wrong \"category\", so for Aberdeenshire and Moray, could you make the following adjustments:= Badge to be \"ed_background.jpg\" (I don\'t have a copy of this on file), rather than am_pennan_low (which I\'ve now deleted)= Logo to \"ed_logo.png (mistakenly updated wrong pic there)(In fact, when I deleted the wrong pics, these images automatically reverted to the default ed_logo.png and ed_background.jpg so perhaps no action needed here)Text layout: Could you check the text spacing at http://vacation-rentals-scotland.com/visiting/aberdeenshire_moray/. The text \"Visiting Aberdeenshire and Moray - Mountains, rivers and coastline in Scotland\'s north-east\" spans two lines and the spacing between the lines looks a little tight.Colon rather than hyphen: Finally, at each visitor\'s guide we have \"Visiting Aberdeenshire and Moray - Mountains, rivers and coastline in Scotland\'s north-east\", etc. with a hyphen; the hypen is hard wired. Could you change it to colon (\"Visiting Aberdeenshire and Moray: Mountains, rivers and coastline in Scotland\'s north-east\").

Usually https://www.vacation-rentals-scotland.com/admin/properties/gf6/bookings/VRSA90910/ would come back with an error msg since 90910 isn't attached to gf6 but to js8-14.

On the GuestComments \"page\", I wonder if we could also put the \"Rated by TripAdvisor\" icon below the FlipKey reviews... just the logo and no hyperlink... that will then be a further reminder about the TripAdvisor rating without sending guests off to another site.I know the lack of a link there may be confusing. However, if a guest then asks about the reviews, we can answer the query, and if we get a lot of such queries then we can think again about how to present the TripAdvisor info.I\'ll also get in touch with FlipKey/TripAdvisor again to see if the widgets for TripAdvisor can be made available.Martin","No image","No file"

One single 'service' account for everything 2. Multiple 'service' accounts 3. Users' own calendars  ## 1. One Single Service Account ## I create a google Service Account, and install it into the application.  This includes a generated email address.  I give you the address.  You create (in your own, i.e. 'Martin', calendar account) any calendars you want, and then you share them with this service account.  Then, when you're in the application, you can choose from any calendars you've shared. This is the simplest approach.   I'll set up two (one for dev, one for live) and toggle between them automatically. This will work so long as you are the only people managing properties.  Anyone who can manage a property will be able to choose from _any_ of the calendars you've shared, and _only_ those calendars.  So, if someone wanted to add their property to VRS but entirely manage it themselves, they would not be able to use the calendar features (well they could but you'd have to let them share their own calendars with the service account, and trust that you won't get them muddled up).  ## 2. Multiple Service Accounts ## In this mode, each property (organisation?) will be associated with one of a number of service accounts.  It will be similar to above except we'll keep track of the service account for each org, and only be able to pick calendars shared with the particular account. There's no way to create these automatically, so I'll maintain the service accounts manually, creating and adding a new one when required.  This would work, but doesn't scale; it would be fine if you had two or three completely independent organisations, but not for 20 or 30.  ## 3. Users' Own Calendars ## In this mode, the app is directly accessing users' calendars.  The user has to authorise it to do so.  So you go to the app, say whose calendar you want to access (e.g. 'martin'), then authenticate, then the system remembers a special token it can use. This approach is probably more what you expect and is familiar if you've used phone or desktop apps that access your calendar.  It has problems in this case: - It needs to work when you're not around, in case the 'token' expires.  There seem to be ways around this but I don't know if they're guaranteed. - It requires a complex authentication process (quite similar to paypal) where the browser has to go to another page, complete a form, then come back to the main app. The advantage is that you could use anyone's calendar without any confusion between organisations.   I recommend plan #1, a single service account, with perhaps some support behind the scenes for plan #2 if we find we need to move to it.  cheers,Alastair","No image","No file"

This sounds good.  Yes, it sounds as though option 1 is the best way forward at this stage since in the first instance it will only be us managing properties (with behind-the-scenes support for option 2 for possible future implementation). This is likely to be the case for some time because for owners where we do a bookings-only service, we don't currently offer the management side; for flats where we do the full management, we operate all the calendars (this includes the slightly hybrid set-up for Albert Terr hybrid, and we resolved this hybrid case by having two separate calendars for Wishy Washy, which is conceptually the right thing to do).  Here's how I understand option 1, just so that we know we're going in the right direction:  So, we create the calendars that we need and then I share the calendars with the service app within the account.   Presumably I also share the calendar with relevant parties, but sending an invitation to them to share/access the calendar;  e.g. at present Nomsa's cleaning schedule was created by me, and shared with Nomsa, Belinda and Ewan; this means that Nomsa can view the schedule and that I, Belinda and Ewan can add entries to Nomsa's schedule when we log bookings.   Under the new system, I would create a calendar for Nomsa and share it with the service app, Nomsa, Belinda and Ewan. This means that Nomsa can view the schedule, that the service app can create entries and that I, Belinda and Ewan can amend entries when we review and log bookings.  Ditto for Ania's calendar, Wishy Washy's calendar, etc.  So, the main difference is that we add the service app into the loop so that it can create entries.  I hope the above makes sense, and that I've understood it correctly. If not, then we can have a chat on the phone to clarify.  Cheers Martin","No image","No file"

Please change the latter to give just the property slug plus date that is hovered over (i.e. just ""wl206 - Wed/19/Dec/12 - low"" is nec, and is useful when navigating around the table, since it's the best way to see what date you have got to. This is to help with navigation since it's hard to see what date you are on in the large table. (2a and 2b) When hovering over a booking in the avail cal the info given is good, but could you give  just the  slug rather than the whole property name: that is sufficient (2a). It's good to still have the range of dates as shown.

The guests often don't specify the property name that they're interested in, but sometimes ask for specific info that suggests they're referring to a particular property. Because this menu bar is available on every page, the potential guest's assumption is that they are enquirying about the property that they are currently looking at. This is the case in 40%-60% of enquiries that come via that link. Could we therefore add another field on the ""get in touch"" page that says ""Which property/properties are you interested in?"" and/or ""Which area/areas are you interested in?"" If possible, this field should be auto-filled with the property that they were looking at when they clicked on ""get in touch"" (but this could be part B of the CR if it's not straightforward to do that in the first fix for this CR). Could we a drop-down menu with the property names and/or the similar ""smart selector"" that we use for country names? The obvious problem is if a guest is interested in more than one property (perhaps we could sjust add a tick box underneath the field ""Am interested in other similar properties"" to get around that. Cheers Martin","No image","No file"

At present I'm sticking with 8 languages (in conjunction with googleAds) to gauge if they have an effect on number of hits on the website.

UK Booking (VRSA62966) showing country code    This is already resolved in Live now, you can see it here:     https://vacation-rentals-scotland.com/admin/properties/park24/bookings/VRSA62966/2. Leaving Column AP blank for CONFIRMED/ACCEPTED/REQUESTED/FULLY_PAID    Actually, column AP already _is_ blank?3. Column AJ to be blank for ACCEPTED/REQUESTED bookings    This is already the case for Live (again, you can see it using the url above)4. For ACCEPTED/REQUESTED Bookings, set AG to be AC/4    I want to check this, as there is already some logic in column AG.  Currently it is:        If the booking has at least one completed payment (deposit or fully paid) then:            - show the total amount paid        Otherwise:            - show an empty field.    So, can you just confirm what you want me to modify this to?5. Booking showing weeks=3, should be weeks=2    This is my mistake.  In my 'isInternational' test, I check to see if the country is the UK.  In this     case, the country was actually ENGLAND.  I've extended the isInternational test to include    ENGLAND etc. and deployed to Beta.cheers,Alastair    ","No image","No file"

I did a test booking and it copies across ok. Here are a few notes, and I'm writing down all the points that I spot as I see them, but we can add any of these as future CRs if they're awkward to implement straightaway:  = The leading single space is still there when I copy the data from the email or from the bookings page, but that's ok because, in fact, the leading spaces disappear in my mail-merged Word template document. = Phone number clean-up: could you include ""/"" as a character to be ""cleaned up"". And + is usually replaced with 00, but that can be part of the ""add international dialling code"" CR. = Can the ""cleaned-up"" numbers be updated on the bookings page too, since we'll be using that data in due course to create the confirmation emails = col.AQ and col.AR: can these be populated with Main Greeter's name and Greeter's mobile respectively? = col.Z: It could be useful to populate this cell with the ""Beds summary"" text from the ""features"" page. But before doing that, can you remind me if we use the ""Beds summary"" text anywhere else? I think that we added this in for precisely this purpose and if so we can up make sure that the ""Beds summary"" info is up to date for all properties before going live. = MEET/KEY setting: this is working ok on the two test bookings that I did. The 14 or 21 day setting is ok for now, but recently we've seen an increase in late bookings, and we now tend to send keys out closer than these dates. Will we be able to reduce those at a later stage if we find that we need to, i.e. for UK bookings we may want to reduce the 14 days to be 10 or 7 (we often send keys out last minute now because they get there in time, and particularly when a payment has been received), and 21 may be better go at 16 or 14 days. Wouldn't need these changes to be configurable, since once we've settled on a pattern then that will probably be fine, but if you're able to make the change as a one-off update then that would be good.

Just what we wanted for a chill-out break. Had a lovely barbeque, and managed to get a suntan. The house was perfect, lovely fresh bed and very comfortable. Thank you for the personal touches - fresh milk, bread and butter. Highly recommend to friends and family, hope to return for another break. Thank you for our stay at Tulach.August 2012 Thank you for the welcome and the nice attentions! We had a very good time here in your very cosy house. We took a lot of squirrel photos! It's beautiful around here and Scotland is one of the most amazing countries we've ever seen. Hope that we can come back again!August 2012 A lovely comfortable house. Everything we need to make our stay perfect. Nice walks right on the doorstep. Places to visit to explore the history. Also central for longer trips into the wilder country. A great stay. Thank you for the trouble and effort you have gone to to make us feel welcome.September 2012 We have thoroughly enjoyed our week here at Tulach cottage. It is an idyllic place and we have been warm and cosy. We have seen the red squirrels and many garden birds: coal tits, chaffinches, robins, blackbirds, thrush and heron who flew nearby, and on the last afternoon a sparrow hawk in the garden looking for smaller birds! A relaxing week in a quiet and peaceful location. Many thanks to Jennifer (owner) for advice prior to our arrival and for the groceries!!September 2012 We saw lots of birds and wildlife, we even saw a woodpecker and some red squirrels. Lovely location, loved every minute in and out. Lovely location for walking and cycling, right from doorstep. This made for an enjoyable stay! Our daughter had a fantastic 7th birthday weekend.October 2012 Thank you so much for our pleasant stay at Tulach. The cottage had everything we could wish for and the groceries were a nice surprise. And thanks for putting the heating on before our arrival. Although we came at a very cold time of year, the cottage was very comfortable! Unfortunately Blair Castle was closed during our stay but Glamis Castle was a very good alternative and we loved it. Also, we walked through the snow at the summit at the funicular train at Aviemore, tasted great whisky in a very lovely tour at Balvenie Distellery in Dufftown, saw the beautiful lochs in the Trossachs, and had some lovely walks. Tulach was based very conveniently in the middle. Thanks Jennifer, and any guests after us, enjoy!November 2012 From London, a wonderfully idyllic escape from the city, and it felt like a ""home away from home"". The cosy cottage, the mountain walks and great local cuisine was a real treat. We would definitely come back again. The summer would be glorious in Blair Atholl so hopefully we should be back with the kids! Many thanks.November 2012","No image","No file"

Sometimes there are e.g. 5 nights available in a gap but only 3 are booked by the guests. Usually it's good to simply fill the gap so we're happy to accept the 3-night price. At peak times though we might want to maximise the gap price and therefore might want to ensure that the price for a 3, 4 or 5 night break within that gap is priced at the 5-night rate. A way of marking this would be to have a tick box for each season called ""Maximise gap price?"" which would have the following behaviour. (We could then tick the box for Peak season and leave it unticked for other seasons, and/or switch it on for other seasons if appropriate.)e.g. peak gap price: 1 night £240; 2 nights £280, 3 nights £390, 4 nights £490, 5 nights £590, 6 nights £690e.g. there's a 5-night gap and prices come up as follows under ""Short breaks starting on"" (at e.g. http://www.vacation-rentals-scotland.com/properties/lt73b/calendar/?arrive=13%2F08%2F2013&month=201308&nights=7&adults=2&children=0#propCalTop):1 night £2402 nights £2803 nights £3904 nights £4905 nights £5906 nights --etc.e.g. ""Maximise gap price?"" box ticked, and then price is adjusted to the minimum of £590, i.e. it comes up at £590 for any of the gap dates1 night £5902 nights £5903 nights £5904 nights £5905 nights £5906 nights --etc.I don't know how easy this adjustment algorithm would be to implement, but wanted to float the idea for future discussion. This CR currently takes low priority. There are other adjustment algorithms that could be good to implement in due course in a similar way to how airlines might adjust prices depending on demand. For example, because spring bookings are currently quite slow, I've been adjusting the mid season for some properties to finish later, so that prices for some properties are lower in May (giving a bigger price differential between properties); potential guests seem to like a price choice as well as a property choice. As those properties at the lower price fill up, it would be good to have an algorithm that adjusts others to the lower price. At present, doing this manually with the help of the availability overview calendar is fine, but there may be ways of formalising these kinds of adjustments... e.g. adding a larger discount %age on some properties and shifting that large discount to other properties if the first ones fill up. Again, this is more of a discussion point for future possible CRs rather than a specific request for now.CheersMartin","No image","No file"

There are quite a lot of booking portals that now offer an option for us to make a ""live offer"" through their site, but this means that we want to put a temporary block on vrs (in fact, U/Unknown is sufficient, because not all of these offers convert). The live offers may expire after e.g. 48 or 72 hours, but currently we have to keep a note of U dates and then manually remove them after a certain period of time. I think we've talked about this possiblity before, and it would be good to have this option on the ""Mark some dates as Closed or Unknown"" page (e.g. https://www.vacation-rentals-scotland.com/admin/properties/ks/bookings/createClosed/). I guess the additional option would be ""Temporary block"" (or some other intuitive name) where:Type = Temporary blockTimePeriod = [option of time period as hours, i.e. with options such as 24, 36, 48, 72, etc.]Arrival date = as seen nowDeparture date = as seen now[possibly also:] External website = with dropdown list of options that I would add in under admin[pssibly also:] Reference = plain text field for a ref number, as with notesNotes = as seen now As with Bookings, I guess that TemporaryBlock would also need to have a status field (e.g. Active/Blocked and Expired, and possibly with an option to reinstate to Active for an additional period of time). Again, I'm just recording this CR for reference, rather than putting it at a high priority. Cheers, Martin  ","No image","No file"

Gap prices are working well, and we can set the prices to be variable for the number of gap nights chosen by a guest. Sometimes there are e.g. 5 nights available in a gap but only 3 are booked by the guests. Usually it's good to simply fill the gap so we're happy to accept the 3-night price. At peak times though we might want to maximise the gap price and therefore might want to ensure that the price for a 3, 4 or 5 night break within that gap is priced at the 5-night rate.

If the owner-email was sent, but the guest-email wasn't, we could email the owner again to say ""never mind that's been cancelled"". 2. Instead of discarding the booking we could save it as Cancelled with a note.  That way you'd be able to go back to it and read what happened for yourself. 3. Try to improve the email validation code to prevent us sending the email.  This is much trickier than it seems at first - although name@domain.suffix is the most common email form, there are literally thousands of hardly-used alternatives.  Also, the user could enter a syntactically valid email address that pointed to nowhere, so it doesn't really solve the problem. cheers,Alastair","No image","No file"

VRSA65941 and VRSA99095, both for GF2 for identical dates and from the same guest.  I received a ""no-reply"" confirmation email for VRSA65941 at 20:48 on 29 May, a copy of confirmation email to guest for VRSA99095 at 20:48 and also a ""no-reply"" confirmation email for VRSA99095 at 20:48. When checking at http://vacation-rentals-scotland.com/admin/properties/gf2/bookings I see that only VRSA99095 shows up, so I'm confirming the booking to the guest with that ref number.  In theory there should never be 2 ref numbers associated with a booking at the same property on the same date. I assume that VRSA65941 did not log properly on the system, and then  RSA99095 was created. But I don't know if VRSA65941 still exists somewhere on the system.  I guess the worry is if VRSA65941 had generated a confirmation email to me but had not confirmed on the database... because then a double booking could have been created at a later date. I'm sure that there's a straightforward explanation (e.g. that the first booking failed and then the app simply created another random booking ref number and correctly confirmed with the second booking ref), but I thought it best to alert you to the fact that the ""no-reply"" email was generate. I'll forward copies of the emails to you separately so that you have them to hand.CheersMartin","No image","No file"

We're failing to send but not stoppingWhen I send the guest message, I ask whether it sent off ok.  If I'm told the email failed then I stop and show the user the form again.  But perhaps I'm getting a failure and then not stopping.  So I'll check that.  At the very least I can put in some logging to say whether I thought the first email sent successfully. 2. Your email server is blocking the bad 'from' addressIt's more likely that I'm sending the message to the guest, getting back an 'apparently ok' result, and then trying to send the message to you.  I set the from address to be the broken guest email.  In that case I wouldn't be surprised if your email server was silently dropping that email, since a bogus 'from' address is a classic sign of spam. If that's the case then there's not much we can do, except feel very pleased that we added the support ticket feature :-) cheers,Alastair","No image","No file"

We now have logging to show that we could at least reach the email server (so that we can show that the app isn't just silently dying); 2. You get a support ticket whether or not the email arrived 3. You get an error report from your own mail server when the email address is bad.   I think that this should cover us for almost all situations.  If we see odd behaviour again we now have the log information to tell us a bit more about what's happened, and either way we should get the message from the customer. So, I'm going to mark this as Ready For Live and deploy it when we next release into Live, if that's ok. cheers,Alastair","No image","No file"

The PayPal payment system has bedded in well, and it's great to get bookings confirmed directly with a payment, since we now cut out a 1-2 day wait until the payment is made manually. I think that only one guest has so far chosen the ""Alternative Payment Method"", so guests seem to be very confident with PayPal.  REQUESTED bookings (if dates are UNKNOWN) still use the old routing where we confirm or decline the booking and then ask for payment for the former. Now that the system is bedded in ok, could we change the routing of these bookings to be the same as for CONFIRMED and FULLY_PAID bookings. I would give you updated working for the confirmation screen and for the confirmation email to say that we need to double-check availability and will refund the payment if not available.  We have this type of payment set-up for the VisitScotland/EmbraceScotland websites: they now have a system in place where paypal payments are taken, but we don't have to guarantee the requested property. The booking wording makes this clear. If the selected property isn't available we email the guests, and in our experience guests often take an alternative (and we can then apply the payment to that property). We always give the option of reversing the PayPal payment and that option has been taken twice.  So on balance, this system would work ok. CheersMartin ","No image","No file"

When we make the changes to route the booking differently, we'd make it clear that the booking is not completely confirmed.  The reasons for making the change for the REQUESTED bookings are (this is as much to remind myself of the reasons for the change as to explain to you, but hopefully it's useful background info!!):1. we have some properties as UNKNOWN cos we need to check with the owner, but in 90% of cases the owner says yes. We have lost a few bookings while guests wait for the answer, but if we have the deposit then we can immediatley confirm to both side.2. I use another website where guests have made payments on the basis that the booking isn't 100% confirmed, and they seem happy to do it. Once or twice, their choice wasn't available but they agreed to an alternative, and I could reallocate the payment. In other cases the refund has been made immediately.*3. On our site, the guests will still have the ""alternative payment method""option, so that they can avoid the PayPal payment (in practice, this isn't being used at all, but it would be interesting to see if it's used more for this scenario).4. some other website are offering a similar set-up where they authorise the payment and when we click ""accept"" the payment comes through to us. In that case the payment is authorised but paid out only when we accept. I think this would be more awkward to implement and the currently suggested set-up is a good first step to test the water, because superficially it requires two changes (a) switch REQUESTED bookings onto the route that asks for payment (b) update the wording for REQUESTED bookings to make the restricitions clear.  * Wording such as this is used in the confirmation email: ""Thank you for submitting your booking request with reference number _____. We will review your request and will contact you shortly to confirm the booking. Please note that all bookings are provisional until confirmed in writing."" I'll look out the full pre-booking wording too and then I'll edit it for our use. Martin","No image","No file"

At present the gap price kicks in e.g. if there is a 5 night gap between two separate bookings. The guests has the opportunity to book 5, 4, 3, 2 or even 1 night at a reduced price. The price varies depending on the number of nights. Sometimes we fill a 5-night gap with 4 nights. This is usually fine in low season, but in peak or high season it would be good to have the option to maximise the number of nights booked. The axiom would be: If ""maximise gap prices"" is switched on, for any gap quote the maximum price for any number of nights. For example:There's a gap of 5 nights and gap price for 5 nights is £590, for 4 nights it's £490, for 3 nights it's £390, etc. If ""maximise gap prices"" is off, return the prices above.

After some email exchanges, I manually created https://www.vacation-rentals-scotland.com/admin/properties/bc/bookings/VRSA74945/ and sent a manual booking email. For info, I include a transcript of the email thread at the end of this bugnote. The guest reported that the booking form wouldn't accept his phone number, and then reported that the booking form wouldn't accept his zip code (85258-1892), so he couldn't complete the booking. We haven't seen this problem before so I don't know if you can check logs to review any attempted bookings by Howard Pals (VRSA62017 and possibly other bookings that didn't go as far as creating a booking ref number) to see what went wrong.  We haven't seen many abandoned bookings, so I don't think this is coming up often (it at all), but I guess it could happen that potential guests try to book, can't progress on the form (before a VRSA number is generated, leading to the booking subsequently being abandoned) and then go elsewhere. So it's probably worth checking the log to try to see if there's a prob with the booking page, or if the guest did something wrong.  ThanksMartin  ================== On 24/01/2015 12:55, Howard Pals wrote: Thanks Martin...for your attention to this matter.I'll look forward to receiving our confirmation and details information, and will send the deposit as soon as a secure method is available.Cordially,Howard Pals  Sent from my iPad On Jan 24, 2015, at 1:04 AM, Vacation Rentals Scotland <info@vacation-rentals-scotland.com> wrote: Hello HowardSorry about the difficulties.

I think that this particular double quote may be a remnant of me copying the guests' info from BC to RC44 (we had to move the guests from one apartment because it's got a major renovation problem). For some reason, the double quote may have been in my excel sheet (not sure why). So, to answer your query, in theory no address should begin with "", but if it were to then I guess the safest is to replace with 2x single quotes... having said that, Excel ignores a single quote and presents the remaining text verbatim (so that you can key in '0039643... and it will present 0039643 in all cases, instead of e.g. using the number format and presenting 39643 instead). Martin  p.s. occasionally we have to move a guest from one propety to another (or a past guest books in again a few months later), but we don't have a way of copying their details across from one booking ref to another. Would it be possible to set add a setting where we can do this?

Copy and Resolve Basically: you can copy seasons over, and the system will check for conflicts.  You can tell it what to do when it sees a conflict. How it would work: You go to a property’s season page.  You click “Copy to other properties”.  You see a list of properties.  You check the properties you want to copy to.  You click Next. For each property, the system works out whether there are conflicts - does the property have a different season listed for any of these dates. The web page shows you a list of properties with conflicts and you decide what you want to do: - Abort the copy altogether- Copy over just the non-conflicting seasons- Copy over but where there’s a conflict, use the property’s value- Copy over completely, blatting the property’s original value. You choose this for each property and then click Confirm to go ahead.  Advantage:- It’s still the same fundamental system as we currently have. Disadvantage- You can’t tell whether the conflict is because you’ve just changed the ‘template’ property and re-applied the seasons, or because one of the target property really does have different settings. - I have to write a fair bit of UI code to handle this “resolve conflicts” page.   2. Season Sets Basically: You can set up a Season Set which is a list of seasons.  Each property is linked to a Season Set.  Properties can add their own seasons to override the default. How it would work: You would have a new section of the admin site: Season Sets.  You would see a list of Sets and could add, edit or remove them.  The Season Set edit page would look pretty much like the property’s season page. When you go to a property’s season page, you can pick your Season Set.  Your page shows all the default seasons from the set, plus any overrides you’ve added. If you change the Season Set, all properties will automatically see the changes.  Advantage:- This is probably how we’d do it if we were building again.  Seasons don’t change much between properties and they’re all pretty much the same.  It just makes sense to use a template.- Changes will automatically ripple out to properties without any extra work.- It’s safer from an “Accidental overwrite” point of view: Changing the Season Set won’t destroy the overrides you’ve set up for a property. Disadvantage:- It’s more code.  I’d have to create the new Season Set admin pages.- The booking / pricing engine would have to know to use Season Sets    Having thought about it, I think the Season Sets is better.  It just feels like option #1 is writing code to work around a bad initial design.","No image","No file"

Look for an override for the given date.   If found, use that.2. Otherwise, look to see if the property has a Season Calendar defined3.

This would mean that when a guest clicks on ""Book now"", instead of generating a confirmation page, a PayPal payment page would come up to take the 25% downpayment to confirm a reservation. We spoke briefly about this last time we met, and I know that this is planned for either vrs-phase-3 or vrs-phase-4. However, now that we can confidently accept bookings, it would be good to complete the transaction so that our first contact with guest is to send them a confirmation email with payment receipt, rather than a confirmation email with request for payment.  c.5% of accepted bookings fall through, and this would avoid that problem.  There would be no change for the option where the guest clicks on ""Enquire about these dates"" since these are Unknown dates that we need to confirm manually. I would propose going to a PayPal invoice page, e.g. for VRSA03426, the booking is for £790.00, and the paypal page/invoice for 25% of this would be https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_xclick&business=accounts%40vacation-rentals-scotland.com&amount=197.50&item_name=VRSA03426:+King's+Stables%3A+August%3A+Reservation+Payment+for+Clark&currency_code=GBP&bn=paywiz4msoe-001.0 (plus other VRS-website / PayPal requirements to allow for the redirection back to the VRS page once payment is made; this invoice is the one that we generate from our database). This is perhaps something we need to discuss in more detail, but I thought the first place to raise the discussion point is here!Martin ","No image","No file"

When a booking is created, a 'notification' is created on the system.  The notification will be reported on the admin pages and will stay there until an authorised user (one of the admin team) mark it as acknowledged.  The way to think about these is probably as Support Tickets.  A Support Ticket is created for anything which needs to be done, and someone picks it up, handles it and marks it as Complete.  In that way we can later extend this to other things - for example, a message sent by the user via the Contact Us page, or a customer deposit which needs to be chased up, or a special request etc.  So from now on I'm going to refer to these as Tickets.The work to be done for this CR includes:1. creating a new 'Ticket' entity in the database and code(Each Ticket has a State - one of [ New, In-Progress, Complete ].  For this CR we only need New and Complete.)2. creating a Ticket every time a booking is successfully created (i.e. once we've successfully sent the confirmation email to the guest)3. displaying a count of New tickets on the admin 'header bar' which shows when you are logged in.  Initially only Administrators will see the Tickets.4. clicking the 'count' will take you to an Admin 'Support Tickets' page5. The Support Tickets page will show a paged list of tickets and their State.  Beside each ticket will be a button to set its state - from New to Complete or back to New.6. (Perhaps) it may be that this page becomes quickly cluttered and we may need to be able to filter to 'Only Show New' tickets.","No image","No file"

When the guest creates a booking by clicking 'Make a booking' on the property book page #2. When the guest requests a booking from the property book page (where VRS can't give an immediate yes/no). #3.

A full support ticket systemIn this approach, the ticket system attempts to track the whole conversation.  So, for example: - the guest fills in the support form- a ticket is raised with the message and you get an email 'from' the ticket system.- when you reply, the reply goes back to the ticket system- the ticket system (TS) updates the ticket with your reply and then relays the reply to the guest- the guest replies to the TS etc. etc. The point is that the TS becomes the hub for all communications, and you can open the ticket at any time and see the whole conversation.  2. Limited, Simplified ticket systemIn this approach, the ticket is really just a reminder.  So, for example: - the guest fills in the support form- a ticket is raised with the message and you get an email 'from' the Guest.  The email might include a link to the ticket.- When you reply, the reply goes to the Guest only - it's up to you to mark the ticket as 'processed'- When the Guest replies, they are replying to you only, the TS won't know about it.  Obviously #1 is ideal, but involves a chunk of work.  Not least is getting email monitoring working, as the TS will actually have to 'listen' for emails from you or guests.  It's all doable.   As a check that the emails have come through (the original purpose for this CR), #2 is fine and I would recommend it for now. ","No image","No file"

This is a very serious issue as this library is used to encrypt a large percentage of the Internet's traffic, including web and email. The security issue could allow anybody to access parts of the encrypted traffic as well as the secret keys used to encrypt that traffic. What we have done As soon as we were made aware of the issue we started updating the OpenSSL version used by our various systems and we replaced the SSL certificates that we were using. As of now all of our systems have been patched and all of our SSL certificates have been replaced. What you should do We are not aware of any data having been compromised but there is a possibility that some may have been so as a precaution we recommend making the following changes:If you are using SSL certificates for your sites there is a risk that your certificates have been compromised. So we recommend that you ask your certificate provider to re-issue your certificates and then open a ticket for us to replace your certificates with the new ones.Once you have replaced your SSL certificate, you should consider that the data secured by your old SSL certificates may have been compromised. Change any passwords or other credentials that were encrypted by your old SSL certificates.We recommend that you change your WebFaction control panel password. Although the WebFaction control panel wasn't vulnerable (it uses a different version of the OpenSSL library) the SSL certificate that it uses may have been compromised because it was also used by other sites which were vulnerable. So there is a small possibility that some control panel passwords may have been compromised.If you're using phpMyAdmin or phpPgAdmin on our servers you should change these passwords.If you are using our email services we recommend that you change your email passwords. You can find more information about the heartbleed bug at http://heartbleed.com  If you have any questions regarding this issue just open a support ticket and our team will reply to you asap. The WebFaction team.","No image","No file"

""owner to arrange"". For the bookings_only properties, we send the owners a summary email of the booking and it's then up to them to make arrangements with the guest. It would be better for us to record this as ""owner to arrange"" for all ""bookings_only"" properties. Sorry that I didn't remember this earlier; I know you've already deployed this to beta, but would you be able to add this extra category and set the default for the above properties? (If in future we were to give owners of these properties access to ""full management"" aspects of the app so that they can manage cleaners/greeters, etc. within our app then of course the key handover would be re-set to ""send keys"", ""meet"", etc. by default.

This dates the widget and makes it look as though we have no new/current reviews.  For properties that we have on TripAdvisor, we'd like to keep the ""Rated by TripAdvisor"" owl icon and text at the top of the property page and at http://vacation-rentals-scotland.com/properties/*#GuestComments, but because of the above problem we need to get rid of the widget (reluctantly!). I think it would be good to have a link that opens in a new page to the FlipKey or TripAdvisor page.

I don't know if there's a # tag that can be added to http://flipkey.com/p242331 to take you straight to the reivews tab. (P.S. have checked this and http://www.flipkey.com/p242331#pdp-reviews works) Could you set all properties with a ""FlipKey code"" setting to have this new behaviour and to link as above? We can keep the FlipKey widget field for now, in case it comes back again. And I'll keep diary entries to keep an eye on the links to make sure they remain active. Also, for ""tidiness"" on the VRS app, sometimes ""FlipKey"" is written ""Flip key"", so if you could update that it would be good. This is absolutely not essential though! [Another but related issue: We have some, but fewer, reviews for on a couple of other websites. For now, we'll just keep with the flipkey links as above, but I'll keep notes about the othe sites here in case we want to link these later, e.g. if we find that we're collecting a lot more reviews through these sites; the industry keeps changing and these reviews may become more important in the coming months.holidaylettings use this format: https://www.holidaylettings.co.uk/rentals/edinburgh/227777#reviews, where 227777 is one of the properties that we advertise with themtripadvisor uses this format: http://www.tripadvisor.com/VacationRentalReview-g186525-d6377936#reviews, where g186525 seems to be our VRS code number and d0000000 seems to be the property numberhomeaway uses this format: http://www.holiday-rentals.co.uk/p861330#reviews, where 861330 is one of the properties that we advertise with them.]","No image","No file"

Date RangeI've taken the date range to be all bookings from 'today' onwards.  If you like, I can have it show historical bookings as well, though I guess external agencies aren't interested in those. 2.

DatesAgreed. 2. Personal infoI'm not crazy about handing out the names, myself.  Your privacy policy says ""We do not pass any personal details of our customers to third parties [except for review requests]"".  So my vote would be No, since the agencies don't need the info. However, that reminds me - you mentioned including the VRSA number, and I actually do include it in the ""UID"" field (Unique IDentifier).  I hadn't realised that you treated that as confidential (which is fair enough, I understand your explanation). If the VRSA number is confidential then I need to include a different unique identifier there.  And it should be one that you can search for later.  That's pretty straightforward to add - should I do it? 3. BlockingI've taken a simpler approach to this.  I already have a piece of logic to decide if a booking ""is blocking"" - it's the logic we use for the guest booking calendar page.  I just use the same logic.  If the booking is blocking according to the rules we've developed in the past, then it goes on the list.  If we decide later to change, add, remove the rules, then I'll change my ""isBlocking"" function and everything that uses it (calendar, ical, gap-finder etc.) will change automatically.   The only odd case is, as you say, Unknown - but we'll keep that as an 'available' patch and won't include it on this page.  Let me know about the identifier, otherwise I think we're all good here, cheers,Alastair ","No image","No file"

To answer your queries: 1. I agree that historical bookings are not relevant, so ok as is.2. The guest's name is of course not necessary for blocking dates, and the primary purpose is to make the dates unavailable. However, I also noticed that some agencies put the guest name, and this is useful as a mnemonic. However, do you think it violates data protection? I think that the agencies wouldn't ""publish"" those names on the public version of the calendar, but only present them to those who are logged into the admin setting. If it's standard procedure, and you think it's ok to include, then I think it's useful. We could potentially put the VRSA number instead, but that in theory is also info that confidential between VRS and the guest (in order to ID them, and would be used by us along with other personal data if we were ""security checking"" a phone call). I don't want to be too uptight about data sharing, but I know that there are now rights and responsibilities, so we should do this correctly! 3. > I've basically included 'blocking' bookings - confirmed, closed etc.  So 'pending' or > 'enquiry' bookings aren't on the list.Yes, I think that's correct, i.e. ACCEPTED, CONFIRMED, PAID, FINISHED, CLOSED are blocking bookings, but these are not blocking bookings: ACCEPTED_PENDING_OWNER, CONFIRMED_PENDING_OWNER, IN PROGRESS, UNKNOWN, REQUESTED(I've checked through the legend below calendar at https://vacation-rentals-scotland.com/admin/properties/ks/bookings to check that I've covered all statuses.) UNKNOWN is a grey area, but for now let's make it non-blocking; we would simply not allow auto-bookings on external sites for properties in this category. I also use UNKNOWN sometimes on bookable properties if, for example, an owner wants to keep an option open on certain dates for a few days, but I think I'll have to change the policy there and simply temporarily block the dates and remove the block later. (This is all fine; I'm just thinking allowed here.) So, to conclude, UNKNOWN dates are non-blocking on the iCal. (another note on this point: this issue would be resolved by http://www.bugnotes.com/showBug.php?b=273; it's a slightly diffferent reason for the functionality requested in bugnote273, and the original reason for bugnote273 is less relevant than it used to be.) Also, if we add any new statuses in the future, we need to decide if they need to be added to the blocking list or not. Finally, there's the status REQUESTED: can you remind me when this status is used; I don't recall seeing or using it recently.CheersMartin","No image","No file"

 Raise a ticket. In all cases of ticket raising, we need to make sure we don't just keep raising hundreds of tickets.  We need a way to understand that there is already a ticket in the system for this particular scenario.  That could be tricky.  Booking Page------------ The 'Value to VRS' field is one that VRS fill in when they receive more information from the booking company.   We should also calculate the price that VRS would charge and store that, displaying it alongside. If the difference is more than 10%, highlight this on the booking page. If the booking is not yet Owned by VRS, highlight this on the booking page.  Tasks TODO---------- [ ] Martin: block out some dates on JS-14[ ] Martin: Send out calendar url for JS-14 for TripAdvisor, AirBnB, Wimdu and HomeAway[ ] Alastair: Look in the calendars for the blocked dates and confirm[ ] Martin: Cancel those blocking dates[ ] Alastair: Look in the calendars for the cancellations - how are they reported? [ ] Martin: Send up to date booking spreadsheet                                           ","No image","No file"

Booking1 is for 1st-10th April.  It gets moved to 11th-20th April and a new Booking2 is created for 1st-5th April.  I have to resolve all of the bookings at once, otherwise it looks as if there's no space for Booking2.   I definitely take your point about wanting to get this running soon, even if you end up with more tickets, and that's what I'm thinking too.  Where I find myself spending too long trying to resolve the situation I may be better just raising a ticket and a 'requested' booking and leaving it up to you to accept or modify it. cheers,Alastair ","No image","No file"

Booking created on AirBnB2. We fetch this, create booking on VRS3. Later, booking is removed from AirBnB4. During fetch, we see the booking is missing... but we say, ""That's ok, it's just AirBnB not telling us about it"".5.

The weaknesses are that (1) sometimes they forget, (2) there's a (shortish) timelag, (3) there's scope for human error, (4) we don't always get notified of cancellations.  Most sites now offer an iCal for the property's calendar that can be pasted into an external site.

I see that there's an option to add more than one calendar to the Wimdu calendar. It seems to work in a way that calendars can be overlaid and if any date from any one cal is marked as blocked then the night gets blocked out. More and more the web portals are encouraging ""instant booking"" (like we have, i.e. CONFIRMED, rather than the CONFIRMED_PENDING_OWNER type of booking that has the build-in timelap; both have their uses for us!), and I think that this is a way of allowing all relevant sites to update. I guess the advantage of having 2 or 3 calendar feeds from e.g. airbnb and homeaway and wimdu coming into a VRS property calendar is that it would allow instant booking to be switched on and any newly blocked dates from those third parties would then be updated on VRS. Of course, since VRS is our centralised booking app, we would subsequently book those guests in on VRS manually, which would block the dates out on the VRS cal. But if the overlaying of the calendars works ok, this ""double blocking"" would be fine. Once the booking is added to the VRS app, all the other calendars would then sync via the send-calendar links, so normally all calendars would have the same blocked dates. But the advantage of overlaying multiple calendars is that we could then experiment with the instant booking options on the other websites. I think that the .ics data will naturally allow for this set-up. And I know there is scope for confusion, so we (i.e. me, Belinda, Ewan) as listings managers will need to set things up correctly. But from a development point of view, I thought it would be helpful to spell these scenarios out in case that affers the development of this CR. Hope this note is clear enough. The holiday-let market is constantly changing, particularly with these big websites competing to ""monetise"" business, but this CR would allow us to try to keep up with them!Cheers, Martin","No image","No file"

Early evening might be difficult, but perhaps sometime on Sat6 or Sun7 if that's ok for your timewise? While some of the shadow bookings will be converted into full bookings, in some cases the block will simply be a blocking of dates (e.g. because the owner manages their property, and they manage any non-VRS bookings). I guess we simply don't convert those shadow bookings to a full booking. Additionally, you raise the issue of blocked dates becoming free again in the future, but we need to decide how to manage this is we've already logged those dates as a firm booking. I guess we'd need to undo some of that manually (because we're writing to the guest about the cancellation, etc.), but we perhaps need  a ticket system to alert us of these changes (and as an audit trail). Having said that, we'd want to keep any alerts/intervention to a minimum (in the way that our ""send"" calendar simply updates external sites without them taking any action.

And raising a ticket for manual resolution is a good way to get something up and running, and we can then work out good ways of reducing the number of tickets as we get experience of them. Your idea of raising a ticket each time a new discrepancy is found is good, so that we can keep track of changes on external websites. From VRS's point of view, there are two main motivations for fetching booked dates:(1) a full syncing of dates from external websites so that we can turn on auto-booking e.g. with Airbnb, for our fully-managed properties, and for these we want a dynamic exchange of bookings;(2) a weaker version which is a simple blocking of dates (with ""no questions asked"" apart from raising a ticket) on our site when an external site shows dates as blocked (this is effectively what the external sites do when reading our iCal).   (1) Is for our listings where we'd like to take auto-bookings across a number of sites. (2) Is for listings where owners maintain their own Airbnb and/or holidayletting pages and where we would like to simply block any dates that become blocked on those external sites.  The upshot of your work seems to be that iCal entries don't give consistent and full info, but this perhaps doesn't matter too much for option (2), and I would take the tickets as a prompt that some new dates had been blocked off, acting on that ticket as quickly as possible (perhaps these alerts could be emailed to me as well as being raised on a /tickets (sub)page. So the first step I think is to simply have a mechanism for (1) making dates Closed if an external site marks dates as closed and (2) raising a ticket highlighting this change which I can accept or decline. That would get us started and would allow me to ask owners for their iCal link from their 3rd party sites. It would therefore mean that they don't need to update us every time they get a booking. It would also avoid a few of the double bookings that we had to deal with over the last week or two (because the owner hadn't kept me up to date quick enough). CheersMartin","No image","No file"

(Of course, for some properties all dates are routinely marked as Unknown, so this course would be good for those not in that category.) Thus, if we find that Closing dates is ""too strong an action"" when using the system, we could toggle the setting to first mark dates as Unknown on our site, so that guests don't get a fully confirmed booking.

Also, it's probably time to update the icons to fall in line with the current trends. Would be better to have a new set of icons that are more pinpoint-like. I recall that when we added the tram icon, we looked at another style of icons; would be good to see what would be good up-to-date options to use for 2016-17! We use house, tram, aeroplane and train icons (I think that's it, although a ferry icon would also be useful). On a zoomed out map the icon needs to be big enough to be seen, and the current icons are good for that. They also reduce in size as you zoom in. But I'm not sure if a more pinpoint-like icon would work in the same way. Most maps on 3rd party websites auto-refresh as you zoom in and out to show properties within the current view. What the best solution would be? Maybe a way of grouping properties on a zoomed-out map would be to have an icon saying ""3 properties at this location"", ""12 properties at this location"", etc. but that might be difficult to implement. Martin ","No image","No file"

A failure in testing with the Sandbox indicates you should review all the following information and upgrade your system’s environment.""   1. SSL Certificate Upgrade---------------------------- Certificates are used to allow the client (us) to verify that we are talking to the real server (PayPal).  At the heart of a certificate is an unguessably large number.  As computers become more powerful, the numbers need to be made larger so that they are still unguessable.  That's what's happening here. Starting in June, PayPal will refuse to respond to any client who does not demand the new certificate. The standard PayPal test server - api-3t.sandbox.paypal.com - has been updated to these certificates.    2. TLS 1.2 and HTTP/1.1 Upgrade------------------------------- Communications to websites use the HTTP protocol.  Communications over secure links use a system called TLS to keep the communication secret.  These upgrades are to protect against people trying to 'spy' on the communications. Starting in June, PayPal will refuse connections unless they are over TLS 1.2 and HTTP/1.1. Again, the standard PayPal test server has been upgraded to insist on these connection types.  3. Discontinue Use of GET Method for Classic NVP/SOAP APIs----------------------------------------------------------- This relates to the way we send and receive information from PayPal - for example, to set up the initial transaction, and to check the status of the transaction later.   A 'GET' is the typical way you fetch information from the web.  Because of this, it tends to be unsecured (anyone can see the address you are Getting from) and possibly cached (so, e.g., if you visit the bbc news site then you're probably getting a copy of the page from your service provider's cache, rather than all the way from the BBC).  PayPal want to avoid both insecure requests and cached responses, so they are insisting we use POSTs.  With a POST, the data is buried in the secured part of the request so cannot be seen.  POST requests are not cached. Starting in June, PayPal will not accept any GET requests. This requirement hasn't made it into the standard PayPal test server yet, but PayPal have set up a temporary test server here:  test-api-3t.sandbox.paypal.com This temporary test server has all the new security requirements.   RESULTS============It appears to be simple to test whether we're up to scratch - simply try against the new temporary test server.  If it works, we're doing everything correctly.   I've tried this all and it works exactly as you'd expect.  So I believe we are ready for the changes already with no further work.           ","No image","No file"

Could you check through these, please, and see if we need to take any action.  Cheers Martin  -------- Forwarded Message --------Subject:2016 merchant security upgrades.Date:Thu, 3 Mar 2016 09:01:49 +0000 (GMT)From:PayPal <paypal@paypal.com>Reply-To:paypal@paypal.comTo:info@vacation-rentals-scotland.com       2016 merchant security upgrades.  Martin Mellor,  We recently announced several security upgrades planned for this year, some of which may require you to make changes to your integration. You’re receiving this email because we’ve identified areas of your integration that may need to be upgraded. What you’re about to read is very technical in nature – we understand that. Please contact the parties responsible for your PayPal integration, or your third party vendor (for example, shopping cart provider, and so on) to review this email. They’re best positioned to help you make the changes outlined in this email and in the 2016 Merchant Security Roadmap Microsite. What do I need to do to as a merchant? Here are the steps you’ll need to take to ensure your integration is up to date and you don’t experience a disruption of service when the changes happen. Step 1: Consult with someone who understands your integration. We encourage you to consult with the parties that set up your integration, which could be a consultant or third-party shopping cart. You may also need to find someone who can assist with making your integration changes. Step 2: Understand how these changes affect your integration. Here are the key areas requiring your attention. If the chart shows “Yes”, you may require changes to be compatible with that security upgrade.If you see a “No,” our data shows that you are already compliant or do not use that functionality. There may be other changes you need to make, but please pay particular attention to the following areas:  ChangeDo I need to make a change?SSL Certificate Upgrade to SHA-256YesTLS 1.2 and HTTP/1.1 UpgradeYesIPN Verification Postback to HTTPSNoIP Address Update for PayPal Secure FTP ServersNoMerchant API Certificate Credential UpgradeNoDiscontinue Use of GET Method for Classic NVP/SOAP APIsYesStep 3: Get the technical details about these changes. Detailed information about each of the changes and a location to test your integration are available on our 2016 Merchant Security Roadmap Microsite. Select the hyperlinks in the chart for information about specific change events. Step 4: Make the appropriate changes by each “Act by” date*. It’s important to have your changes in place by the “Act by” date for each change event. Step 5: Future-proof your integration. We recommend that you go through the Best Practices section on our 2016 Merchant Security Roadmap Microsite. Why is PayPal making these changes? Protecting customer information is PayPal’s top priority. We support industry standards, such as crypto-industry’s mandate to upgrade SSL certificates to SHA-256, and Payment Card Industry (PCI) Council’s TLS 1.2 mandate. We also surpass those standards by investing in and building some of the finest protection available. By addressing these changes this year, we believe it helps future-proof your integration and reduce the need to invest in changing your integration in the near future. If you have any questions, visit our Help Centre by clicking Help on any PayPal page. If you require further assistance, please call us on 805 542 713. Thank you for your support of our commitment to maintain the highest security standards for all our global customers. *Scheduled change dates, including “Act by” dates, provided in this email and the PayPal 2016 Merchant Security Roadmap are subject to change.

Ditto for #3 and #4. Not according to the report from AirBnB.  It has this entry: BEGIN:VEVENTDTEND;VALUE=DATE:20160830DTSTART;VALUE=DATE:20160815UID:-yhbekj1bnh57-pnydq619cj2t@airbnb.comSUMMARY:VRSEND:VEVENT Note the dates - 15th August 2016 to 30th August 2016.  But booking VRSA47159's dates are 15th to the 22nd.  Booking VRSA16111's dates are then 23rd to 29th (checking out 30th).   So from the computer's point of view, no, there is no booking on AirBnB that matches either of these bookings.  A human can look at this and say, yes, that's actually one block on AirBnB that covers both bookings, but the computer can't do that (at least, not without a lot more rules). Question: On AirBnB, are these recorded as two separate bookings?  Or is there just 'one' booking with dates 15-30th?   > > #6, 9, 11, 12 ... 20 replicates one of the entries at 1 Yes, for the same reason.  The computer sees a booking on AirBnB.  There's no matching booking on our system.  But there is a closed interval on our system - maybe that's the same thing?  So it raises a ticket.   Now, of course, the computer could just *assume* that this is a match.  It could say: - There's a booking on AirBnB- There's no such booking on VRS- There's a CLOSED interval with the same dates on VRS- Just assume that's ok and silently skip. ...which is fine.  But remember, the computer has *no common sense*.  It can't decide when to decide.  So for example: - Agency1 marks dates as closed- Agency2 accepts a booking for those dates- Computer is quite happy and you don't get a warning ...because from the computer's point of view, that's exactly the thing you've told it to ignore.   So, your options are: 1. Accept this risk2. Don't mark the dates as closed, mark them as booked (so they match)3. Add extra custom rules to say, ok, for *this* property I want you to assume *this*, but not for *that* property. (I advise against #3 - it will make things more complicated and harder to debug, and will take longer to set up)(Also, if the computer adds bookings automatically, such as in action #7, it will add them as *bookings*, not closed intervals.)  > > #7 is a good one: it's a booking that Stuart has on Airbnb and that we> #don't have closed off. So we need to close off these dates (I've not> #done that yet, so that you have a chance to review this). 8 is the> #same booking. Yes, #7 and #8 are two actions associated.  Action #7 is to create a booking on VRS, action #8 is to raise a ticket to alert you.  > #10: not sure what dates/booking this ticket refers to? I should put more info into the action details, but you can see it in the log:   Check incoming AgencyBooking [NTKDNJ RES: 12/05/2016-14/05/2016 ""Isham""]      ! Don't have this booking already and can't make it - raise a ticket.          * Action #10 - RAISE_TICKET ""AirBnB Fetch: 'new' booking but can't place it!""   The computer can't find any VRS booking with the same daes.  Maybe it's a new booking?  But there isn't a gap for it to fit into. Looking at the VRS bookings, you have a Closed interval VRSA85073 - 12/05/2016 to 15/05/2016.  Presumably that's the closed period corresponding to this booking?  But the dates don't match - the VRS closed interval is 12-15th but the Agency booking is 12-14th.   So from the computer's point of view there's no VRS booking (or closed interval) that matches the same dates, but there's also no gap to fit this booking into.  Hence the ticket.   > #21: This looks like blocked off dates on Airbnb that correspond to> #our two bookings VRSA47159 and VRSA16111 Yes, this is the same situation as #6, #9 etc. > > beyond: #21...

Agency Booking vs. Local Closed So the problem is, how can we tell if our Closed interval is just the dates we've blocked out for an Agency booking?   What I've gone for is to look at the Source Agency for our closed interval.  If it's the same Agency then I'll assume that these are some dates you've blocked off for this booking. If you look at the action report now, you'll see that Action 2 says:  ""AirBnB Fetch: AgencyBooking TBE4E9 matches local Closed interval VRSA79635 from different Agency (Vacation Rentals Scotland)"". If you go to this Closed interval on VRS (VRSA79635) and set the Source Agency to AirBnB, and run the test again... you won't get this warning. So: If we have a Closed interval that matches the Agency's Booking, and if we've said that this Closed interval came from the same Agency, then the computer will assume it's ok.    2. More details on the Clashing Booking Before, there was a case where our local closed interval didn't exactly match the agency booking (VRSA85073).  The ticket didn't explain this, but it now does (It's action #7 as I write this). 3. Marked the 'end of report'I've added an '[end of report]' marker so you can see that you've reached the end of each of the reports. cheers,Alastair ","No image","No file"

This is Stuart at BE2 (Boyd's Entry), and the Airbnb export cal link is https://www.airbnb.co.uk/calendar/ical/4844341.ics?s=25659a5740966e3c6b882225650987e7. The Airbnb listing is https://www.airbnb.co.uk/rooms/4844341 (and it's possible to view the calendar on this page). Typically there are two actions:(1) Stuart sends me an email when he takes a booking through Airbnb and I go to .../bookings/createClosed and close off those dates.(2) We take a booking (_PENDING_OWNER) for Stuart, I alert him and if he accepts the booking we log it and confirm with the guest. Stuart immediately blocks out the dates on Airbnb. When we have the ""fetch booking dates"" up and running, in theory any newly closed dates on Airbnb can be closed off on VRS (with or without a ticket being raised; perhaps with a ticket to start with so that we can check). In the meantime Stuart will continue to send me the dates so that we can cross check. When we send a booking to Stuart, he closes off the dates. Our booking on VRS would then correspond to those closed off dates. (I guess that if all this works, another step would be to invite Stuart to add our ical to his Airbnb listing so that he doesn't need to take that action. But fine to leave that at present so that we can test this one step at a time.) I have added this link at https://vacation-rentals-scotland.com/admin/properties/be2/agencies/ and run a report. Here's my analysis of the info in the Actions tab:#1: RAISE_TICKET: “AirBnB Fetch: Closed intervals differ” : These are dates that we have closed off because Stuart has his own bookings, and the first few on the report in April that I checked confirm this.#2: VRSA47159: RAISE_TICKET: “AirBnB Fetch: Booking VRSA47159 missing from Fetch” : We have this booking and it's correctly blocked out on Stuart's Airbnb calendar, so no need to raise a ticket because blocked dates match?Ditto for #3 and #4.#6, #9, #11, #12 ... #20 replicates one of the entries at #1#7 is a good one: it's a booking that Stuart has on Airbnb and that we don't have closed off. So we need to close off these dates (I've not done that yet, so that you have a chance to review this). #8 is the same booking. #10: not sure what dates/booking this ticket refers to?#21: This looks like blocked off dates on Airbnb that correspond to our two bookings VRSA47159 and VRSA16111beyond: #21...

Perhaps we should have a chat on the phone to decide how to best implement the syncing with the information available. Seems that some human intervention is needed, but we can perhaps set it up so that dates are blocked and then confirmed by human confirmation (or left unblocked and subsequently blocked if confirmed), depending on context. It's clear that other agencies take blocked dates ""as gospel"" and simply block those date on their calendar (it being our responsibility to know if we've sent the correct dates or not). But as we've found out this simple method doesn't work for syncing across a number of calendars. Anyway, it would be good to use the reports that you can now create and to make some calendar updates along with a ticket system that allows me to confirm/decline blocked dates as they come up. But a quick chat might be a good way to work out the best way forward if you're free one evening or afternoon. Martin","No image","No file"

I can be flexible on day and time, although I'll probably be out on either Sat morning or Sun morning Your changes are good. For point 1, athttps://www.vacation-rentals-scotland.com/admin/properties/*/bookings/create/and at https://www.vacation-rentals-scotland.com/admin/properties/*/bookings/createClosed/could you add in a field so that we can include the source agency when creating a booking? When creating a booking generated from an external source, I usually do a search as if I were a guest and then go through the bookig process, creating the booking using our email address and adding the agency ref and guest email address in the ""Anything else?"" box (we then use the database data info when logging the booking and sending the confirmation email to the guest). This works fine to quickly block the dates and record the guest info.  Perhaps we could amend this process slightly so that if we're logged in, an option of an amended booking form comes up at e.g. https://vacation-rentals-scotland.com/properties/wl206/book/?arrive=13%2F03%2F2017&nights=16&adults=2&loc=edinburgh&children=0&qstart=13%2F03%2F2017&qnights=16E.g. have a red button at the start of the form for those logged into the VRS app entitled ""VRS created booking"" or suchlike. It would have the same cells as the standard booking form plus some additional ones and it would generate a different confirmation email to go out to the guest. The additional cells would include a drop-down menu so that we can record the agency source (and booking reference if available), a box for the confirmed price (this usually differs from our web price), etc.  This would help us to record the data in the correct fields, and the database data would be more accurate than in the current work-around. It would also mean that the agency source is recorded for calendar syncing. Martin","No image","No file"

Special Search PageThis would be like a special, property-specific version of our search results page.  It would show: - The property summary details- The search terms used- A list of the different options we’ve come up with, depending on their ‘wobble’ settings. Each item on the list would be for the same property, but with the different start dates and durations.  If they’ve said no wobble then it might be only one entry.  Each item would have a link to the property page and the ‘direct booking’ link that takes you straight to the calendar.   2. Special Calendar PageThis would be like the current booking calendar page, but would include: - Property summary info (and perhaps a photo)- The search terms used The calendar would have the ‘best’ option pre-selected - in our case that would be the one closest to the search terms.   Which do you think?  Of the two, the Calendar page is probably simpler to implement, and involves one less step for the guest.  But the Search Page is perhaps closer to what VS are expecting, and might be useful in other cases (e.g. when you want to look at the options for a single property yourself and just browse the different price options).  cheers, Alastair","No image","No file"

But a couple of years ago VS had to remove the search/booking engine because of EU regulations regarding state subsidy to businesses (VS is/was a government agency that receives some EU subsidies, I believe). We had 4 properties on the VS website, and we are able to set up online searches via a third-party agency. VS has allowed a number of third-party agencies to intergrate their booking system so that VS users can search for dates, get a list of properties available and then click through to a third-party agency site to complete the booking. Two years ago VS dragged their feet when I asked if we could integrate our property listings on VS with their system, but when I followed up last week they are happy to allow us to do it now. The advantage is that we could then add all of our inventory to the VS website, but still take bookings solely on VRS. Following yours and my discussion last week about TA/HA/Airbnb taking a lot of the enquiries, my google searches for accommodation show that the VS site still comes up quite high. It would therefore be a high priority to encourage searches/bookings for our properties on the VS site. My contact at VS is going to send some API instructions in the next few days. Would you have a look at these to see how we can go about integrating with VS? I think it will be a matter of (1) allowing search requests to access VRS and reporting back properties/prices for given dates, and (2) then allowing the guest to click through on a BookNow link when they have selected one of our properties to come fully onto VRS and complete the booking fully on VRS.  I'll send you further documentation about this when I have it. CheersMartin ","No image","No file"

I'm sure a lot of it will already be covered by by the way our bookings work, i.e. they can deal with problem cases, missing info, etc. and give sensible error msgs where necessary). Obviously some adjustments might be needed, e.g. our child age range is 2-14 and theirs is 3-16, and they also have an infants category (0-2), which we don't include because guests usually tell us if they have a baby (or simply leave them off the search) and request a travel cot when required. The system covers hotels/self-caterin/caravans, but we should be able to get the right parameters (hopefully partly because VRS app is modelled on the earlier VS app!). I understand that the actual booking process would be on our website, so once prices are returned and a guests decides to book, the ""Book now"" would take them to our booking page (possibly this page http://vacation-rentals-scotland.com/properties/gf6/book/?qs=1910032, or http://vacation-rentals-scotland.com/properties/gf6/calendar/?arrive=19%2F10%2F2016&month=201610&nights=3&adults=2&loc=edinburgh&children=0&qstart=19%2F10%2F2016&qnights=3), but I'm sure that all will become clear as we progress through this. By the way, I had to sign a non-disclosure agreement with VS, so do you know if this bugnotes.com site is secure for uploading the files (having said that, VS emailed them to me rather than send a download link)? CheersMartin ","No image","No file"

I know there are other scenarios. Oh, and I'll go through bookings an add in agency source and ID to clear a lot of the teething actions that get raised, and in future (when we systematically add the agency source), these can create tickets because it will be due to an error. This is for Airbnb, at least... I guess Wimdu (and other agencies) will have different rules. Incidentally, while TripAdvisor don't yet have an export cal option, I'm sure it'll come soon because each of these agencies seem to keep up with the others. I called TA today to ask about it, and they are happy to add suggestions like this to their feedback (but implication was that others have also enquired).

It should flag the fact that the agency calendar has those dates available.  The report lists this booking in the Local Bookings but does not highlight the discrepancy. The owner hasn't yet added our cal to their Airbnb listing (so they have to manually block off the dates) (some owners are slow to add the link, some can't find where to add it, plus some may not want us to have write access to their calendar, so we cannot rely on those links being added properly, or not being deleted at a later date). Would you expect this to be flagged? I'm going to write to the owner to ask him to block those dates on his Airbnb listing (so the issue should go away shortly), but at the moment (Wed 13/4/16 12:50pm) there is a discrepancy that isn't highlighted on the actions list. CheersMartin","No image","No file"

If the summary includes ""[VRS"" then it's a VRS booking2. If the summary is ""Not available"" then it's an Airbnb 'closed' interval3. If the summary has a reference in round brackets then it's an Airbnb booking4. If the summary is ""vrs"" or ""vacation rentals scotland"" then it's a 'placeholder' booking added by the owner to Airbnb to reflect an existing booking on VRS5. If the agency uses our iCalendar, then this is probably an Airbnb booking (because anything imported from us won't get sent back to us, so anything that does get sent back to us must be from them!)6.

Airbnb imports our iCalendar2. Airbnb imported booking VRSA68358 via our iCal3. By default, all AgencyCalendars are set to say ""agency doesn't import from us""4. We fetch from Airbnb (this particular fetch was at 8am)5. Airbnb doesn't report back imported bookings, so we don't see VRSA68358 in the results Now, if we thought Airbnb was importing from us, that would be fine - it just wasn't reporting it back to us.  But the setting says that Airbnb doesn't import from us, which means that someone needs to manually add that booking - and if we don't see it, we should raise a ticket.   So... 6. We raise a ticket 7. At some later point, you update the AgencyCalendar entry to say, ""Airbnb does import from us""8. Now, when you run the fetch again, the fetcher is happy.  It can't see the booking, but that's ok because it's not expecting to see it, because Airbnb don't report back bookings they've imported. So - no bug, it's just an old ticket from before you fixed the config in the AgencyCalendar. cheers,Alastair ","No image","No file"

Wimdu had a booking, TZJ7MPTC, with dates 12th-28th April2. On VRS you created a matching booking, VRSA146363. The booking dates changed to April 12th-20th.4. VRS booking hadn't changed.5. Wimdu requested the iCalendar and we sent it out - with the original booking still 20th-28th.6. Wimdu created a new booking for this time.  It has the original VRS identifier7. We download the new calendar and see a VRS booking8. We match this based on dates, but then get very confused - on our database this is a Wimdu booking, but the incoming details say it's a VRS one! It's exacerbated by the fact that the 'moved' booking is now in the past, and so gets ignored by the booking importer; if it was still in the report you'd see a ticket about it getting moved and it would probably all make sense.  First problem is that JS8-12 now has booked out dates on Wimdu.  For starters you should cancel this entry in Wimdu. Second problem, how to avoid it in the future?  (And I suspect it's not just a Wimdu issue). I think this may be why Airbnb only send back their own booking entries.  We can't quite do that.  If we import a booking from Wimdu, we should include it in our export to Airbnb, for example.   But perhaps our calendar export to an Agency should not send out bookings that were sourced from the Agency. If we did that, then when the original booking moved, Wimdu wouldn't have imported our old copy - because our old copy says it was sourced from Wimdu.   I can't think of any situation where this would cause a problem, so long as we keep the source agency correct (and if we don't you should see a ticket complaining). What do you think? cheers,Alastair   ","No image","No file"

It sounds as though your adjustments will do that.  >> 1. In the iCalendar export, don't export agency bookings back to the agency we got them from  That's fine.

Ticket is correctly raised because there's a mismatch in dates, and I can act on that manually. In future, Airbnb bookings will come in as fetched bookings, whereas this is a set of Closed dates that generates a ticket. This raises a couple of questions/resoluations for the clash:(1) If this had been a full booking, would the ticket have been raised (i.e. it wasn't raised for the booking in ticket 514, so the answer is maybe ""no"" even though it should be raised)?(2) To remedy the clash, I can adjust the Closed dates (VRSA64900) to be correct. This is fine, but ideally we want the system to pick up these changes and make the adjustments.(3) Since this is not a ""proper booking"" but just a Closed set of dates, I have deleted the Closed dates (VRSA64900) and refreshed the Airbnb External Calendar import.

When I accepted the booking the data was of course not updated (i.e. vrs database data was still ""PENDING Alice"" rather than ""Alice Lacey""). (Airbnb must have a Pending state and a Confirmed state; I don't know if they report this distinction in the calendar export.) To try to force the update, I set VRSA11859 to the state ""Cancelled"" and refreshed the Airbnb Agency Import Calendar. Presumably the booking should have been fetched again (with correct full name, plus mobile/email) because the dates weren't blocked on vrs but there was a booking on Airbnb. However, no data was fetched. (1) Do some settings need to be changed to ensure this booking is fetched again? (2) Also, if Airbnb data changes, is it possible to add/amend the data on vrs (with caution, or only certain data)? Or perhaps Airbnb doesn't update the export calendar with the guest's email/mobile/surname when the booking status on Airbnb changes from pending to confirmed? It may be that we will need to add this data in manually (in response to an alert that info doesn't match, but ideally if Airbnb reports the info it would be good to be able to add it to the booking.  (3) Finally, while looking at Airbnb data: is any price info reported in the calendar data from Airbnb. If the answer is no, then no action needed. If the answer is yes then I'll raise a separate CR about including this in fetched booking data. CheersMartin p.s. if you need more details for this note, please let me know","No image","No file"

Reservation date is importantThe date when you make the booking matters, because it's the distance between then and the booking start date that controls the 'late booking' discount.  Currently the price engine always assumes that the booking date is 'today'.  But when moving a booking, the booking date should probably be the date on which the guest first made the booking. This isn't so hard to implement,  I think. 2. Season price info may have changedThere's no way around this one.  If I recalculate the price it will be on the current set of season price info; if that's different from when the guest first made the booking, it will end up in a different price. 3. The Bookable Slice MapThis is the tricky one. We store prices in a Bookable Slice Map.  It is a list of all the available intervals and the price information attached to each interval.  For example, in february you might have three bookings and two seasons - the slice map creates a slice for each combination of availability and season info. Storing things this way allows us to very quickly calculate both availability and price.  If there isn't a slice available for every day of the requested dates, we're not available.  And once you've got the slices, you can work out the price. But, when you move a booking, the booking is already in the system - so the dates are not available.  So if I try to calculate the price, it will return ""not available"". To work around this, I'll have to create a new method that creates a special version of the slice map that ignores the target booking - treating it like a gap - and then calculate the price based on that.  These things are solvable, but time consuming (probably 2-3 hours' development plus testing).  I can solve them first as part of this CR, or leave them for later.  What would you like me to do? cheers,Alastair ","No image","No file"

The case study is necp/VRSA62460, 4-11 Aug, 7 nights. The guest emailed to say that he'd be leaving on 12 Aug (rather than 11 Aug). I checked VRSA62460 and it correctly reports Airbnb MXRDBS as 7 nights until 11 Aug. On Airbnb's app I can request a change to the booking, which I did. I alter the booking to be 8 nights from 4-12 Aug, and the guest is alerted to accept or reject this update via the Airbnb app (the price is automatically adjusted by Airbnb). When the guest accepted the change, ticket 4342 was raised alerting us to the mismatch of dates.* I then have to manually update the dates at VRSA62460 to the new dates. I also have to update our database, our changeover schedule and googleCal entries. So there are a few manual tasks that I have to do in any case (in future, when we come back to implementing the googleCal set-up, googleCal entries will automatically adjust). Because an adjustment of dates is relatively rare, we could continue to deal with the above manually, and the ticket system correctly raises the alert. If this comes up frequently (and/or depending on how other Agencies deal with these changes), perhaps we could implement the ""controlling agency"" plan. In the meantime I think this perhaps isn't an urgent CR. What do you think?Martin * just as a check, I cleared 4342 and resynced the Airbnb cal to see that a new ticket is raised; it is raised (4362). I've now updated the dates for VRSA62460 to be 8 nights and the ticket has cleared ok.","No image","No file"

Yes, seems very weird to close one night and then close the remaining separately. At least it allows for a new case study, and confirms that we need to ensure all dates closed on Airbnb are also closed locally.  I've now imported the Airbnb sync link for WL521, with mixed results. There are still some dates that should be closed off but that aren't. Details herewith: Process used: Again, I first noted all locally closed dates and then removed them manually. Most have been created by the Airbnb import, but we still have the ""only first night"" blocked problem. The Airbnb cal for this listing (https://www.airbnb.co.uk/rooms/2462829 corresponds to WL521) shows that more dates should be closed. So it seems that the fix isn't working properly. These dates should be closed, but only the first night is; should the latest fixed have picked these up and closed them off?:16-20/5 - 4ni28/5-4/6 - 7ni4-7/6 - 3ni24-27/6 - 3ni4-12/8 - 8ni25-29/8 - 4ni I'll try to encourage owners to block off the dates with a note stating ""VRS"" or ""VRSA12345"" so that the connection is stronger. But I can't enforce this, so it's definitely correct to honour all closed dates on Airbnb and to close them off locally (raising a ticket if there's a conflict, so that we can confirm).  CheersMartin","No image","No file"

So there are only two instances of Wimdu reporting ""zero nights"". We have a broompark booking for 9-14/6/16 from Airbnb, which is recorded as VRSA00446. Wimdu has the correct dates blocked out. So this isn't an start/end date prob because it's within a closed set of dates. We don't have a bc booking for the period, but the owner has 28-30/5/16 blocked off on Airbnb, and this fetched the booking VRSA31381. Wimdu has the correct dates blocked out. In this case the ""zero nights"" is 28/5-28/5/16. CheersMartin","No image","No file"

Sometimes the property slug is quite long and it would be useful to use a shorter verions, e.g. otw instead of otw4-9 for Old Tolbooth Wynd, or j14 instead of js8-14 for Jeffrey Street (Flat 14). Once I've set a property slug, and if we have third-party listings using the hyperlink for the property (and/or I've sent the link to the owner), we don't want to change the slug. However for day-to-day use the shorter slug would be useful. So, for otw4-9 I would add otw as the secondary slug, but if we were to add another property e.g. otw16-8, I could update the secondary slug to be otw4 but still keep the originaly otw4-9 as the primary slug, i.e. the secondary slug is changeable over time but the primary is always retained. Could you add a field for ""Additional slug"" or ""Secondary slug"", which always points to that property and which can be used as well as the primary slug? It would act like an auto-redirect but would be fixed on a property by property basis. If could also be used in conjunction with auto-redirects. (I guess it would be similar to the ""additional location"" feature that you implemented recently.) CheersMartin","No image","No file"

Thanks, Martin WEBFACTION MSG:  Thank you for using WebFaction for your hosting needs! If you want a ""cross-over"" time then you would need to migrate the data yourself. Please request the migration at the following link.http://my.webfaction.com/migrateIf you want to migrate the data then we would add a new server to your account. You would then need to move everything to the new server. Once you have moved everything to the new server you should let us know as we will charge you for two servers until the old one is removed.If you want us to migrate the data then we would lower the TTL for any domains using our name servers. Simulate the migration and then schedule it upon a successful simulation. We try to move as much of the data before the actual migration window. Once the migration window arrives we would disable the sites and physically move the data. Once the data has been transferred we would enable the sites and activate a proxy on the old server that runs for three days to redirect any traffic arriving at the old server. Typically most scheduled migrations that WebFaction does has less than forty five minutes of downtime.Hope this helps! Please let us know if you have any further questions.","No image","No file"

Below I've copied some notes from the https://my.webfaction.com/migrate page; all standard disclaimer stuff, but thought you might want to have a shifty at it.CheersMartin Here are a few things you need to know if you're requesting a migration done by WebFaction:Your websites will be down during the migration. Depending on how much data you have this can last between a few minutes up to several hours. If you want to avoid downtime on your website or it is in anyway critical then we strongly suggest that you manage the migration manually.If you're using non-WebFaction DNS servers for some of your domains you will have to update them yourself after the migration.If you're migrating from CentOS 5 or CentOS 6 to CentOS 7 you may need to make a few adjustments after the migration. See this page for more info.We will keep your data on the original server for one week after the migration (so you can ask us to revert the migration during that time). After that the data will be deleted.In no event shall WebFaction be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, special, exemplary or consequential damages. (including but not limited to loss of data, non-delivery or incorrect delivery of service, service interruptions and data security) however caused and arising in anyway out of the use of our migration service.Please read and accept the terms of service below I have read and accept the following terms of serviceFirst some definitions: - ""We"", ""Us"" and related words refer to WebFaction. - ""You"", ""Your"" and related words refer to the customer - ""affected sites"" is any sites, applications or other code running as your main user or any of your extra users on the server which you are migrating away from.WebFaction's server migration is designed for customers who want to move their site to a new server with minimal effort and who don't mind there being downtime associated with the migration or not being able to test every step before it is applied. If you want to avoid downtime on your website or it is in anyway critical then we strongly suggest that you manage the migration manually.During the migration process the affected sites will be unavailable. Anyone browsing to them will see a holding page which says ""Coming soon: Another fine website hosted by WebFaction"". The duration of this downtime cannot be predicted in advanced but will depend mainly on how much data there is to migrate. For small sites it might only be a few minutes. If there is lots of data to migrate, especially if there are large databases to move then the downtime could last several hours. We recommend that you allow for at least 4 hours of downtime, but it could be more. If you have very large amounts of data to move please contact us before arranging the migration so that we can give you a better estimate of the downtime. If we are migrating multiple sites then all of the sites will be down until all of the data for all of the sites has been transferred.Most migrations work flawlessly, however some applications and websites can malfunction or stop working after the migration. Common problems include: - Sites or apps which depend on a particular version of a piece of software which has changed on the new server - Sites or apps which depend on a particular piece of software which is not installed on the new server - Sites or apps which rely on the machine they are running on having a particular hostname, IP address, or other identifying feature which is different on the new server.WebFaction will not test your websites during or after the migration. It is your responsibility to test the operation of your sites and applications and make sure that they are working as expected after the migration. If any of your software malfunctions or stops working after the migration WebFaction is not responsible for fixing it.If you are migrating to the same operating system then the installed software will be similar but we cannot guarantee that there are absolutely no differences. If you are migrating to a different operating system then the new server will have significantly different versions of lots of key software and libraries. The new server might also be be missing software or libraries which were installed on the old server. Any compiled binaries which are migrated from the old server to the new server will need to be recompiled or replaced with a new version before they work on a new operating system. You will be responsible for doing that (see http://docs.webfaction.com/user-guide/moving.html#migrating-from-a-centos-5-32-bit-server-to-a-centos-6-64-bit-server our documentation for some examples of how to do that).During the migration all of your cronjobs and long running processes will be stopped. If you have any timed or recurring tasks which were scheduled to be run during the migration they will be missed. It is your responsibility to make sure this is not a problem.The migration process will not affect you email which will continue to work as normal. If you are using our mail2script service to send emails to a program running on the server which you are migrating away from, then emails that would normally be sent to that program during the migration will be lost.After the migration the affected sites will be on a new web server which has a new hostname and new IP addresses. If you are using WebFaction's DNS servers then we will automatically update them to use the new IP addresses for your domain names. If you use DNS servers which are not managed by WebFaction then it is your responsibility to update those DNS servers to use the new IP addresses. Until that is done your websites will be inaccessible. Similarly any other systems or tools which refer to your sites by hostname or IP address will need to be updated with the new details. Making such updates are your responsibility.Due to the nature of the DNS system, the changes we make to the IP address of your websites will not be visible to all web browsers instantly. Those changes take some time to propagate through the world wide DNS system before all browsers see the new address. As part of the migration process we will set the time-to-live (TTL) for your domain names to 60 seconds so it should only take a minute for the new address to be visible everywhere. If you are using DNS servers not controlled by WebFaction then we recommend that you lower the TTL for your domains in advance of the migration. Failure to do so may result in parts of the internet continuing to use the old address and be unable to access your site for several days. Also note that some external DNS servers, ISPs, routers, web browsers or other services might cache the old IP address beyond the TTL limit. Anyone using such a service will not be able to access your site until the service updates itself to the new address. This is out of our control.If you are unhappy with the results of the migration for any reason you have 7 days after the migration within which you can ask WebFaction to revert the migration. Reverting the migration will return all of the sites, users, applications and other data to the original server. Your access to the old server will be reinstated and your access to the new server removed. All files and data will be reverted to the state that they were in before the migration took place.  This means that new or altered data which happened on the new server will be discarded and lost. If you want to save any of that new or altered data please contact us before asking for your migration to be reverted.In no event shall WebFaction be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, special, exemplary or consequential damages. (including but not limited to loss of data, non-delivery or incorrect delivery of service, service interruptions and data security) however caused and arising in anyway out of the use of our migration service. Notwithstanding the above, WebFaction expressly limits its damages to the Customer to those laid out in our Refund policy.Special instructions If you have any special requests or comments (for instance if you want to be migrated to a specific server) then enter them there ","No image","No file"

Multiple Fetches Currently we make a single fetch - to Edlets - and get back info on every booking.  To add this support, I'd then need to make another fetch for every single property returned in the first fetch.  This would make the overall time longer.  Given that we make these fetches for every property, things like that start to add up. We could moderate it by perhaps only fetching this information the first time we saw the booking.  That would be quicker and would give us at least initial data.  But it would mean that if anything changed - like the customer filling in address details, correcting name or updating price - then we wouldn't pick it up. 2. Parsing Human Data The data we get back from the calendar fetch is in a ""machine readable"" form - very tightly structured to make it easy for a computer to read, and rigid so we know it won't change. This extra link points to a ""human"" web page, designed to look nice.  We would have to parse the data out of this page.  That's a little harder, a little more error-prone, and subject to change if the owners of the site decide to re-make the page (to make it look nicer for the humans, for example).  So, yes, but it's a bit of work and there are performance implications. I think it wouldn't be too hard for Edlets to include this information in the DESCRIPTION field of their calendar events, just like the name and other details.  It would definitely be worth asking - they might be able to just drop it in.  It's better for them too - better to have machines reading the info out of their calendar rather than trying to parse their human websites.","No image","No file"

Edlets agree a price with the guest (based on our prices) and if a booking goes ahead they take a 10% commission. Sometimes they phone us to negotiate a slightly lower price for the guest, or they might adjust their %age for a high-value booking.

A URL is included in the export cal that gives all guest info (name, email, pricing, etc.) Here's the reply from Edlets on specific points: ===========================Hello Martin,  Sorry for the delay in getting back to you, I've had a busy couple of weeks which is slowing down progress of this project.  Unfortunately we can't change the calendar format in this development cycle, but most of the data you're asking for is either present, or accessible elsewhere. I've pointed this out in the example calendar and answered your queries below.  Example calendar file:  BEGIN:VEVENT SUMMARY:BOOKED (Elisabeth Mulcahy) DTSTART;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20160721T230000Z DTEND;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20160731T230000Z UID:9327811/bookings@edlets.com CREATED;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20160502T084714Z DESCRIPTION:Edlets booking #8478147nGuest name: Elisabeth MulcahynPerson s: 4nTotal charge: 1066.67GBP (including edlets fee) LOCATION:Kilgraston Apartment URL:https://www.edlets.com/booking/correspond/owner?action=owner_correspond&bookingno=8478147&session_id=53438315263644565514241662976 END:VEVENT  One thing that would be really useful in both cases would be to include your unique Edlets booking reference. This allows us (and you) to uniquely identify the bookings. Is this the ref in UID? If not, could you add that ref in. The number in the UID field is not the booking reference, it is not possible for us to use booking reference here since 'unavailable' events may be included in the ical file and these do not have a booking reference.  The Edlets booking ID is present in the DESCRIPTION field:  ""booking #8478147n"" and in the URL field ""bookingno=8478147&"" You could use regular expressions to extract it from either. eg. to extract booking reference from the URL field: ""bookingno=(/d+)&""   Could you also add in fields showing the gross and net amount of rent (i.e. the booking amount and the amount minus the Edlets percentage). This allows us to track payment amounts due. Please also include fields with the guest's details, i.e. name, surname, email, mobile phone, address, since our files can then pick this up for our booking database. Unfortunately this data cannot be included at present as it would adversely affect performance when the system is in production. If your developer is writing automation that requires this data, they could use the url in the URL field to perform an HTTP GET or POST request. The HTML returned contains all the data above.   You give a field ""LOCATION:Kilgraston Apartment""; can you also add in our reference, i.e. ""OWNER_CODE:KC1-9"", as an extra field. We do not have an 'external reference' field  for accommodation listings. There are an increasing number reasons to add this however, so I think there will be such a field in the near future.   Also, we have a calendar export which it would be good if you can use instead of or in addition to the date-blocking that you already pick up from our website. For example, for Kilgraston Court (KC1-9) the export calendar is https://vacation-rentals-scotland.com/properties/kc1-9/ical/l4qc1c2x287je7h226yt5u9uzuztsxnv.ics?agency=edlets so that you have another one for ref, this is the export calendar for Greyfriars (Flat 6) (GF6): https://vacation-rentals-scotland.com/properties/gf6/ical/y0c288gj7haaq1t3u3pi60nne0ynitsg.ics?agency=edlets  No problem, we can use this method instead of the existing one if you prefer. If you want us to do this, please let me know and I will send you a list of your active edlets listings so you can reply with the caelndar filename for each.

VS: Good to see the VS stuff coming along, although it sounds as though the testing process is... umm... testing; quite a lot of strict criteria. VS's term ""units"" has always grated with me, but I think that basically it means ""a property"" or ""an apartment"". Can you equate it to that? Some guests talk about arriving at ""the unit"", so I think it might be a US/Oz term and/or a hospitality term. Not sure. I don’t think that’s it.  They have “products”, which are then split into “units”.  If you had a chain of hotels, for example, each hotel would be a product and each room in the hotel would be a unit.  So when the guest ran a search, you might come back and say, “Yes, the Mellor Motel has spaces for that time - one normal room at £50 and one exec room at £100”.  The problem is that for us, the product is the unit.  We don’t distinguish, so we have no way to provide test data that has multiple units.  But of course that’s not a reason for us not to integrate with them - we just need them to say, “yes ok we understand that the unit tests won’t work for you”. Other fails: yes, hopefully Andrew will be able to enlighten you.  2. Strange that it's not working correctly.

It struck me that it may be possible to collate this info via the VRS app, and it would be good to discuss a strategy for collecting contact details so that we can distinguish between actual bookings and emails that we have on file that are just enquiries, etc.  There may also be an option to link in with Mailchimp and add them in to Mailchimp as each booking is confirmed (would need to indicate in the T&Cs that we're doing this, and on all Mailchimp correspondence, guests have the option to unsubscribe to future emails). This isn't an urgent CR, but if part of the VS integration involves collecting & uploading this data to VS, it might be worth considering the broader strategy and options of doing the same with Mailchimp (or other client) while building that part of the integration. I've marked it as CR01 for that purpose, and can downgrade to another CR number once I've had your feedback. It could be that this is simply a separate CR and, if so, we can turn to it in due course, once other priorities are dealt with. CheersMartin","No image","No file"

The ticket reports ""This closed interval doesn't exist in VRS, but there is a gap for it.  Creating it now."" However, there was already a CONFIRMED PENDING OWNER booking for 13-23 Sept (VRSA60256). The new CLOSED dates of VRSA62559 have overwritten the booking VRSA60256. This is for property CG123-4. Background: VRSA60256 was confirmed by VRS and reported to the owner, who closed off the dates on his Airbnb calendar manually. He prefers to have control over his calendar so imported bookings from VRS don't  sync automatically. However, we have an export cal link from Airbnb, which functions correctly. The owner tends to close off one extra night on Airbnb cal (but he's not very responsive to changing this when I email him, and at least the right number of nights are blocked off on Airbnb + one extra night). Tickets 5039 and 5040 for CG123-4 alert us to the fact that the closed interval differ. (Cf. 5037 and 5038 for BC, which is owned by the same owner and has the same problem.) Because I accept that the owner keeps adding an extra night, I marked tickets 5037-5040 as ignore, in order to clear them. However, ticket 5041 has been created alerting us to the new closed dates in VRSA62559, which creates the conflict. This should be impossible, and if any alert were given then we would expect a ""Closed intervals differ"" alert. Could you investigate why this conflict has come up, and how it's occurred. Since I took the same action with two bookings at two properties, one might expect a similar problem with the BC booking VRSA32391. But a conflicting CLOSED interval hasn't been created for that booking.  Hope this is enough information. Let me know if this isn't clear enough and we can talk it over on the phone when you return from holiday. CheersMartin  ","No image","No file"

Rather than do this manually, would you be able to do a search and replace across the pages for this string? While parking is still free on Sun mornings, I think that this updated text is ok (if not 100% accurate) to alert guests that they need to check the signs.ThanksMartin ","No image","No file"

Martin Mellor,  At PayPal, security and safety are our top priorities and as a result, we’re implementing a series of security upgrades throughout 2016 and 2017.   To comply with industry standards, we’re moving the SSL certificates on our endpoints to stronger encryption known as SHA-256 starting after 30 September 2016. Compatibility with SHA-256 will help strengthen your protection and ensure that your business systems are up to date with the latest security measures.   If your systems aren’t SHA-256 compatible, your business will be unable to accept payments with PayPal until changes are made. For more details on our transition to SHA-256, please visit our SSL Certificate Upgrade Microsite.   How to Prepare  To prepare for the full cutover starting after 30 September 2016, we’ll be performing a series of tests on our endpoints starting in July 2016. The purpose for the testing is to ensure we’ve helped our merchants prepare for the full transition to SHA-256 happening after 30 September 2016. For a complete list of testing dates and times, please go to SSL Certificate Upgrade Microsite for the details. We’ll follow up with you with a separate email, if you’re impacted during our testing.  Security Upgrades Coming in June 2017  We also wanted to remind you that we’ve rescheduled several of our upgrades to accommodate merchants who couldn’t meet our original timelines. The following schedule shows details of whether your business is already compatible or doesn't use the functionality. If you do need to make security upgrades, the schedule will identify what changes need to be made.

Under the data protection act, we should delete personal data when it's no longer needed. We can retain data for identifying bookings, but we shouldn't keep personal info longer than necessary. I guess this means that for all bookings that finished e.g. 3 years ago (or some other period of time), we should delete first name, email address, phone numbers and postal addresses, retaining only the surname as an identifier (and possibly also first name) along with the booking number and booking details.  Each Nov/Dec I gather email addresses of guests from the last 12 months and add them to a mailing list on MailChimp (for our annual season's greetings, and possibly for other marketing through the year). Recipients are told that they have been added because there were past guests (which is fine under our 'privacy notice'), and they have the option to unsubscribe at any time. Of course, some of the email addresses with MailChimp are >3 yrs old, but that's fine as long as the past guests remain subscribed. But we don't need to retain the info on the VRS app (even though it's secure and only accessible to admin users). So, two requests:(1) can you add a feature to the VRS app that auto-deletes specified data after x amount of time (probably 36 months)? Could be done as a sweep annually, or could be set to auto-delete when the departure date is x amount of time old. I know we have back-ups of data too, but in due course the historical data would be removed from those backups too, and that's fine as long as we know it's fully deleted.(2) Once a year (or possibly more frequently), it would be good to be able to extract all new email addresses from the database with first/last name (and maybe also mobile number), so that I can add these to MailChimp. MailChimp factors out any repeats, so it's not essential to compare data with previous periods. Could you add a feature that allows me to query the VRS app for this info (and to download it as e.g. an Excel file, and I can let you know what format is best for MailChimp). Hope this is clear. Let me know if you need more info.CheersMartin","No image","No file"

See ticket #9194. Yesterday, 29-30Nov2017 was blocked out under VRSA88176 (ticket #9187). Additionally, this morning VRSA52424 has been created to block CG257 today, 30Nov-1Dec2016 (ticket 9193), although over the last few days when these blocks have happened it's been mainly for 1 year ahead. This is a new issue that hasn't come up before, but it started happening for a number of properties a few days ago.  My suspicion is that it's to do with a setting on Airbnb: On Airbnb one can adjust the Availability Settings saying that you need advance notice for a booking (e.g. ""At least 1 day's notice"", ""At least 2 days' notice"", etc. or ""Same day (customisable cutoff hour""). CG257 is currently set as needing 1 day's notice. So, perhaps this morning Airbnb is blocking 1 night at CG257 (i.e. 30Nov2016) so that no one can request a booking for CG257 today. However, the VRS app picked up the wrong year and blocked 30Nov2017 instead of 30Nov2016. This block wouldn't happen every day for every property, because if a property is already booked then the dates do not need to be blocked out. Other similar closed intervals of 1 night:= 9182 for tp35: 29-30Nov2016 blocked on 29Nov; if this is because of the Airbnb setting then this is correct.= 9170 for park24: 28-29Nov2017 blocked on 28 Nov= 9169 for gbd5: 28-29Nov2017 blocked on 28 Nov= 9153 and 9154: one for 2016 and one for 2017 for rs37= 9151: one for 2017 for s80-7 (Incidentally, but note that ticket 9187 doesn't confirm the year, so not that VRSA88176 is deleted, it's unclear in 9187 if the closed dates were for 29-30Nov2017 or 29-30Nov2016.) Also, there are currently a lot of ""Airbnb Fetch: Closed intervals differ"" and ""Edlets Fetch: Closed intervals differ"", etc. alerts being generated, and I've not had a chance to look at these in detail. I don't know if these are related, but probably best to first check the Airbnb single night blocks. Cheers, Martin","No image","No file"

There are now a few single nights blocked for 5-Dec-17 for 1 night on VRS, viz. tickets 9300, 9301, 9302, 9303, 9306, 9307 for gf6, gbd5, park24, rc44, shp and cl respectively. Now, Airbnb make dates available for 12 months into the future (or the user can set this to be 3 months or 6 months if preferred), and on Airbnb all dates from 5-Dec-17 (e.g. for the above 6 properties) are not available, but they remain available on the VRS calendar (except for 5-6 Dec 17). So presumably on Airbnb the calendar for the above properties changed today to release 4 Dec 17 and to keep 5 Dec 17 onward blocked. I wonder if this is the action that is causing the single dates to be blocked? The intersting thing is that this morning none of the 1-Dec-17 single nights were shown on Airbnb as unavailable, yet we had created a single night block for those dates. So, it seems that Airbnb is sending a cal request to block the date and yet a couple of days later it has released the date again. I guess that one possible solution is to ignore a request from Airbnb to block a single night 12 months in the future. This could cause problems if the is a real desire to block off one night 12 months hence, but that scenario is unusual or non-existant (e.g. if an owner asked me to do that, I would create the closed date manually on VRS and it would very likely be for >1 night in any case). Hope this background info is useful. It might help to explain why these single nights are being block.CheersMartin  ","No image","No file"

Better 'duplicate' checking Generally I use a combination of booking, property, agency and title to decide whether a ticket has already been raised.  For ""Closed intervals differ"" this wasn't working because it wasn't raising new tickets.  I've extended the check so that I can use extra information.  For the Closed Intervals Differ case, I now use the complete list of local and agency differences.  So basically you will always get a new ticket if the situation changes.  What you'll see is that there will be a whole cluster of 'new' tickets raised.  Some are tickets that should have been raised before but were being falsely squashed.  Some of them are existing cases, but since the title has changed they're coming up again. After that, you should see new Closed Intervals Differ cases whenever the closed intervals differ and the situation has changed.  So, there will be more raised, but still only when something has actually changed. cheers,Alastair  ","No image","No file"

Start a new scheme - VRSCnnnnn2. When the app starts, find the booking with the highest nnnnn value in the database, store it in memory3. Every time I need a new booking number, take the one in memory, add one, store that in memory, and use this new number.  Check the database to make sure it hasn't been used. The 'take and increment' approach can be made thread-safe, which means that even if bookings came in at the same microsecond they would still get two different numbers. Anyway, it's not difficult though it's probably a couple of hours' work.  Let me know if you would like to do this. cheers,Alastair ","No image","No file"

And we're just getting alerts and blocks for Airbnb dates of a single night for today's date. Could you suppress the ticket alerts for these ""bookings"" since quite a few come in each day? Before we decide on that change, could we consider an alternative option: Another option (which might be easier since it might be an extension of the ""1 year ahead"" block), is to ignore single night bookings from Airbnb that are for today's date. In theory, VRS  can accept bookings at most properties for the same arrival day, and in any case if a guest books for today's date, they get an alert that we need to double check with an owner before confirming since it's for an arrival that starts very soon. So while Airbnb block off today's date for bookings, I'm happy for VRS not to block a single night starting on today's date. CheersMartin ","No image","No file"

We wanted to give the user the option of not paying by paypal2. We didn't like the paypal button3. We wanted to log the full transaction on the server. So the user clicks 'paypal' and 'next', the request goes to our server, we log it, we then send a redirect back to the browser and it then goes to the paypal site.  ...but this is all just a guess.  So...

I don't know if this is the mode that PayPal refers to as ""Standard Buttons"".  Addressing the possible errors that they list, in the links that we use, we might use the commas if the amount is over 999.99 (and we can make sure that we edit out the comma in future). We also use currency symbol GBP in the link, so I will need to ask PayPal what we should use instead. We would not send a link in which the amount is empty or zero. So, it seems that ExpressCheckout is ok. Standard Buttons is not ok. Do you think that this relates the the link above? If so, we can no doubt remedy any errors and all should be ok. CheersMartin   ","No image","No file"

When I paste in ""alpha[tab]'12345[tab]beta"", I see that the 12345 has been interpreted as text, but still actually shows the ' symbol at the start.  If I then go to the cell and click enter it changes to hide the apostrophe. 3. In the spreadsheet, I selected the middle column and chose ""Format Cells..."" and then chose TEXT.  Now, when I paste in the original string, it shows as text even though it seems to be a number. So, I suggest you try option #3 and see if that works in your Excel?  If not then I can put in the apostrophe for you, which is a 'nearly good enough' solution. cheers,Alastair ","No image","No file"

Occasionally guests book a year or more in advance, and we can usually honour those bookings (or alert guests if a flat can't be guaranteed that far ahead). However, we often don't notice that a booking is an advance one (e.g. VRSA41922 is for Aug 2018) until logging it, and for VRSA41922 I am checking with the guests to ask if they have made an error.  Could you set up the confirmation email to the guest (and the no-reply VRS alert email) to have a prefix in the subject line for bookings 11 or more months in advance? If this is relatively straightforward to do, I suggest adding the following:""[Please check and confirm month/year of this booking, which is a long way in advance]""(or suchlike). CheersMartin p.s. hope you're well and that you had a good Easter. I know you're busy with work, business trips and holiday, but let me know when you get a chance to work through the CR01s that we thought would be relatively quick to do. I may also have some queries about the tickets, which have settled down again but I am still getting a bit of over reporting. Cheers, M","No image","No file"

This will allow visitors to search for accommodation availability on the site. Once the visitor clicks search they’ll be re-directed to VisitScotland where they’ll see the search results. The only difference from your perspective is that this search will fall under the channel VS-WEB-OCUK (as opposed to just VS-WEB) and you’ll see that in the queries we send you. Could you please reflect this addition in the monthly booking report that you upload? i.e. any bookings (failed, cancelled or successful) should now include both VS-WEB and VS-WEB-OCUK.Hope that’s all ok but please let me know if you have any queries.Best regards Andrew CraigAccount ManagerVisitScotlandMonteith House11 George SquareGlasgowG2 1DY Email: andrew.craig@visitscotland.comTelephone: 0141 566 4024Mobile: 07872 345 606Fax: 0131 472 2043 ","No image","No file"

The fetch is not actually trying to create a booking - what it reports is: ""Fetch from HomeAway includes a 'Non-Agency' booking, but no suitable local booking matches these dates. "" (You can see that by looking at its report). It's raised tickets for this. It believes that there's something strange about the booking - that HomeAway are reporting it as having come from someone else (e.g. us, perhaps) but we're not showing any record of it. The fetcher is then doing the right thing - it's raised a ticket to say you should investigate this but has not tried to create a booking automatically. What's odd is that the test run is returning a different result. I'll have a look at what's going on there. Also, I'll investigate as to why the fetcher thinks this is a NonAgency booking.

You should have seen a cluster of new bookings come in now. Karl - it appears that the Agency Booking Fetcher can stall occasionally. When this happens, new fetches aren't carried out. I imagine that some error in the fetch is causing the fetcher thread to die and not be resumed.  The workaround for now is to restart the server. We need to find out why the thread is dying and stop that. We should also look for some way to monitor this, because the agency fetcher is now a very important part of the VRS system. cheers,Alastair  ","No image","No file"

Martin Alastair reply to Martin: Yeah it's not really sorted out, we have to figure out what's making this happen. A way to check is to press the 'refresh' button (above the 'Test' button). The ""Last Fetched"" time should change - if it doesn't, the fetcher has fallen over. ","No image","No file"

I still have access to this document, and I'm sure that Alastair can also give you access to it. I don't think you've worked on the database data yet, so it would be good to get started with some more basic changes so that you are familiar with this. It would be good to establish a routine so that I can request changes to this data knowing that you can implement the changes. For example, here are some changes I'd like to make that are hopefully quite simple:= at present the col.L (Source agency name, or ""vrs online"" if source is VRS.) gives the source agency name, or ""vrs online"" if the source is VRS. I'd like to change this so that the VRSAnnnn ref number is used in col.L if the source is VRS.= in col.AR (Main Greeter phone number) the main greeter phone number is given. There's a bug here and for some properties a 0 is included before the 7 of the mobile number. For example, for Mid Steil (midsteil), col.AR returns with 07788541213 instead of 7788541213. Same issue for Greenbank Drive (gbd5), Broompark (broompark) and Bank Park Lodge (lb_bpl). Other properties seem to be ok. I'll have other change requests for the database data but wanted to first establish that you can make these changes. thanksMartin ","No image","No file"

Good luck with the house purchase! Here are Alastair's notes about creating a pricing fetch to send out to external agencies, which followed the discussion that I  had with Alastair. As discussed, we can take this bugnote as the umbrella one, and you are welcome to create a number sub-tasks to work on, leading up to the completion of this umbrella one. Here are the notes:  1. Pricing FetchWe can provide, on demand, a report of effective “price per night” values for the next 366 days for any given property. TravelNest could then use this to update their own system.  [MM note: and other agencies, e.g. Wimdu can accept a feed, and TripAdvisor will be making this option available soon] We’ll return this in some machine-readable form - either JSON or XML, it’s up to them (My own preference would be for JSON).Potentially we could also provide them with:- weekly prices for each of the next 52 weeks for each property[- monthly prices for each of the next 52 weeks for each property, prob based on the longer-stay disc]- The ‘high’ and ‘low’ occupancy numbers, and the price modifier to apply- The minimum stay[- The maximum stay: we already have a value for this set per property]2. Price CalculationI think the way to do this would be to start at the current date and look for every gap between now and next year.Base the price-per-night on - the length of the gap, or - a five-night stay (if the gap is more than five nights long)Calculate the price, including modifiers for:- late booking discount (assuming the customer booked the property on the day of the fetch)- gap filling- season etc.But not including:- low / high occupancy modifier.If the property is not available for a given night, show the price as blank.3. NotesWe will have some small discrepancies.  For example:- Gap Discount. We give a gap discount for bookings that fill an awkward gap. If we work out the price for a 3-night gap, it will probably include a gap discount. If the customer takes that price and only books for two nights, the price they see will be less than if they had gone to our site.[MM note: this might be resolved by us stating a minimum number of nights, and linked with the toggle for gap discounts that allows us to maximise the gap]","No image","No file"

In the first instance for this CR, could you do an assessment for the pricing fetch to see what work would be involved and how long you estimate it might take, using the broad method outlined in the 28 Oct 13:43 post for this bugnote. There are a number of agencies to which we might be able to feed pricing info, but they are just starting to develop their systems and I'm not yet 100% sure of the format required (or if they will accept data from us). For example, TripAdvisor said they would be starting a development phase with a test environment in December and we can be part of that. So we won't know much more until then. TravelNest might not be able to take the feed from us, but I'm speaking to them again this week about it. However, Wimdu can take a feed: Wimdu have an option available already and we can probably feed our pricing fetch data to them quite quickly (but I'd rather have a brief assessment from you first in case other agencies need different info). Wimdu said that they would be able to take a JSON or XML feed to update prices. They have also helpfully sent a sample XML feed: http://www2.agentur-fischmarkt.de/_ftp-synchro/wimdu_preise.xml. Glancing at this, it looks like the sort of thing that you can provide (including weekly price, as well as nightly price, which Wimdu supports). So our feed will likely have different parameters from the sample, but it sounds as though they are flexible in what they can use. (I can translate any of the German if you need it translated but it's probably pretty much self-explanatory!)It seems that other websites are also allowing content API now or soon but I need to see if they will be able to work with our feeds. Some might need a more season based pricing structure (plus availability calendar), but I think that should also be ok to create.Thanks Martin","No image","No file"

Good to know that you can see where you can access the data for these fetches. >> so it should just be a case of creating the report and making it available in the required formats. Yes, the format will be different depending on how the agency wants the info presented. I think we have a good idea for Wimdu of how to best present the data because of the sample they sent. I shall also try to get a sample from TravelNest, but they are being a bit slow. TripAdvisor plan to start developing a pricing system in December and I've asked if we can be kept up to date on the development plans for that.  So it's perhaps worth starting to generate the data (esp. for Wimdu) with a view that we will need to assess how best to present it once we have more info from the agencies.     >> In terms of them accessing the data is the idea that we have an end point which can be>> used by TravelNest, Wimdu..etc to access the information?  >> so for example something like http://vacation-rentals->> scotland.com/price_fetch/[control code]/[prop_id]/[format]  >> which would generate the report for them? or are we to generate a file for each 'user'>> which is sent to them a specific times?I think perhaps we'll general a file for each 'user' that we send at specific times, similar to the ical reports (see the page for each property at e.g. https://vacation-rentals-scotland.com/admin/properties/wl610/agencies) that are pushed to each agency/user on a regular basis.   Let me know if this isn't clear and of any other queries.  Cheers  Martin","No image","No file"

I guess that when we're generating a price/night we should have a broad array of calculations that can then be calculated up for each external website in the format that they can work with. On VRS I think we have a base price, and then a low-occupancy discount and a high-occupancy surcharge. Depending on the size of property, these apply for different numbers of guests, so there are certainly a number of parameters to set for the right prices.Martin","No image","No file"

How's the price fetching task coming along? Do you feel that it's making good progress?   And in terms of calculating the price, have you started thinking about the formulae for these yet? Perhaps we can chat about that when you're at that stage because of the pricing differences between price/night and our price layout.   At present we have a number of seasonal prices (low, med, high, peak, peak(discounted)), and I'd like to add a couple more to allow for some customisable adjustments like ""late price adjustment"" and ""temporary price adjustment"" and ""special offer"". They would behave in the same way as other seasons, and I'd activate them via changes to the season calendars. A while ago, Alastair added in ""peak(discounted)"" as a new rate, so it should be (relatively) straightforward to add in additional seasons.

We need to now ensure that guests explicitly tick a box to agree to these terms and conditions.  On the booking form there are some mandatory fields, and the best place to add this tick box is probably on the booking form when guests are giving name, address, etc.  Could you add in a tick-box field (that has to be ticked to continue) beside a link to Terms & Conditions (which will pop-up in a  new smaller window, or will expand on the page: which do you recommend?). Would also be good to add a second non-mandatory tickbox with this text beside it ""Please tick here if you would like to receive occasional emails with news of our activities, season's greetings, etc. You can let us know at any time if you do not want your information to be used in this way and we will remove you from the list.""

We would like two tick boxes at this point in the booking process, and the second tick box is to give guests the option to explicitly request adding name to email list (I'll send the precise wording for the tick-box once it's set up). We send out a December ""marketing"" email annually, and potentially can send out other emails during the year. As you know, most sites have this as an option. Also, it is crucial in the next few weeks because the GDPR that comes into force in May requires us to record and be able to demonstrate explicit acceptance for email marketing lists for anyone on this list.As well as an unticked-tickbox that  guests have to explicitly tick to accept, please also include an audit entry in the ""History"" box on a booking for (similar to e.g. ""05-Feb-2018 23:29:03 | New booking from Agency fetch."" at https://vacation-rentals-scotland.com/admin/properties/rc44/bookings/VRSA94399/ or ""14-Feb-2018 15:31:47 | Guest has paid deposit (Payment ref VP-V78KB-YPGY2)"" at 14-Feb-2018 15:31:47 | Guest has paid deposit (Payment ref VP-V78KB-YPGY2)) that says ""no to mailing list (declared on booking form VRSAnnnnn)"" or ""no to mailing list (declared on booking form VRSAnnnnn)"". I'd also like to record this in the database data (probably at columnBE), so that the info is carried across to our bookings database. It might be prudent to record the info in two fields: a ""yes/no"" field, and a ""source"" field (i.e. with statuses ""declared on booking form VRSAnnnnn"", ""declared via Mailchimp"", ""declared in confirmmation email"", and ""declared in post-stay email"", etc., the latter of which I would use to catalogue responses from guests to our subsequent emails; we use mailchimp for the mailing lists and before the May deadline we have a chance to ask previous guest to ""re-sign-up"" to the mailing list). Please would you prioritise this CR along with the terms&conditions CR so that we have this in place ahead of the law change. ThanksMartin","No image","No file"

However, at present if you omit a field that's obligatory nothing happens when you click to go to the next page, and no alert if given. The could leave guests thinking that the page has frozen or that the booking link doesn't work.  Another piece of obligatory info is a mobile or a landline number. These fields are not asterisked (because it's an either/or), but if both of the fields are left blank you get the error message ""Please enter a mobile or landline number so we can contact you about your booking if we need to."" (this would also be good as a pop-up field or suchlike so that it is more visible and obvious when it comes up?). We should also have an alert if any of the other fields are not filled in. This includes the new T&C field: we need an alert to say these must be accepted to continue.  I've tested a booking where I don't tick the T&C box and that prompted me to write this bugnote. I've also tested a booking where I leave out some other info; the form doesn't progress; I then added the info and tried to progress and still it doesn't go to the next page. This could be a separate bug, but it seems that if the form isn't filled in correctly, it appears to freeze. Could you check this and make adjustments as necessary? It could be that these alerts used to come up and for some reason they have become disabled; I can't remember if they used to be there, so it could be that then need to be implemented to tidy up this part of the bookings process. Hope this note is clear enough; as usual, please let me know if you need further info, or confirm that this is note makes sense.

The disk use is more or less split into two parts: 1. Automatic nightly backups, which live in ~/bkps/vrs/old They use about 98Gb in total but that shouldn't change much as a script runs every night to remove old backups (we keep the most recent five backups). 2. Temporary messages from the Agency Fetcher. These live in ~/tmp/agency-fetches. Every time we carry out an Agency Fetch, we store the response here. We do this so that we can diagnose any issues later. Each one is very small, but they add up over time. They're arranged by month and property, so for example: ~/tmp/agency-fetches/broompark/201810/ (lots of messages)~/tmp/agency-fetches/broompark/201811/ (lots of messages)~/tmp/agency-fetches/broompark/201812/ (lots of messages) To clear out some space, I removed every folder before 201810, i.e. everything before the start of October. This cleared out about 15Gb of space. I've been onto the disk usage page at webfaction: https://my.webfaction.com/disk_usage Oddly, it's now showing your available mailbox size as 22Gb – did you increase it? There are two mail accounts that are being used a lot - they are: marts - 4.64Gbvrsaccounts - 3.49Gb Different email addresses go to different mailboxes. You can see which ones go where by looking at https://my.webfaction.com/emails I'm pretty sure the VRS app never reads emails, so we don't need anything in these mailboxes. Are you using them? It's possible that they're just stuffed with status messages that can be purged. However, I don't know the passwords for them – do you? cheers,Alastair ","No image","No file"

There are a few types of captcha tests these days (https://developers.google.com/recaptcha/docs/versions)a basic summary:v3: requires no user interaction. I would call the function when a user (or bot) sumbits information on a form. The Captcha would then return a score (1.0 being likley a human, and 0.0 being likely a bot) then, based on the result I could stop the sumbition or let is proceed.v2: adds an ""I'm not a robot"" checkbox to the page. this will either let the user through or present them with a challenge to prove whether or not they are a human.v2 (invisible): This, like v3, wont require the user to anything. When the user clicks the sumbit button the captcha will run and only challenge the use if it highly suspects its a bot.Out of these options I would suggest the first as it would be less intrusive to the user, also as it sends the score to the backend it would give us some analysis. It would be a little bit more work but not alot, maybe an extra couple of hours.The second option is probably the easiest to implement.CheersKarl","No image","No file"

Every month we 'keep' the backup from the 1st of the month (they live in bkps/old/keep). Each one uses about 6Gb, and we've had two more since the last time we looked.  So, to make space I've removed the four oldest 'keep' backups – that is, the backups from Jan/Feb/March/April 2018. That's freed up about 23Gb, which should keep everyone happy for a while. If you want, we could download all the 'keep' backups for 2018 to a safe location and then remove them from the site. You'd need to think about where to keep them – with the first four months removed they're now about 50Gb.

I've also modified the overnight 'purge' script to clear out very old bkps and agency fetch details. You should find that there's acres of space now :-) The technical details are:- Every night we back up and store current backup in ~/bkps/vrs- We store the previous nights' backups in ~/bkps/vrs/old- We run a 'purge_backups' script which does a few things:- 1. Move the backup from the 1st of each month into a special 'keep' directory- 2. Delete any other backups older than 5 days So the idea is that you have a nightly backup for the past five nights, and permanent monthly backups.  What I've done is this:1. Keep only the last 3 days of regular backups, instead of 52. Delete monthly backups older than 6 months old  In addition, we keep the details of every agency fetch we make, in ~/tmp/agency_fetches. These can really pile up (80Gb when I checked this morning). So I've also added this step: 3. Delete records in ~/tmp/agency_fetches older than 60 days. This should keep the space down from now on, cheers,Alastair ","No image","No file"

What I've noticed in the past is that when an owner (or we) blocks out e.g. 3 nights as ""unavailable"" on the airbnb cal (rather than as a booking), it was those dates that didn't come across.  Now that they are being reported, we're getting the blocks from Airbnb 366+367 days into the future because Airbnb block dates after 12months. (example: VRSA34418 for KS and tickets overnight tonight: 121767 and 121789). Some properties are set on Airbnb to show the calendar only 9 months ahead, and in those cases (see e.g. VRSA18093 at CL at https://vacation-rentals-scotland.com/admin/properties/cl/bookings/year/2020) a full 3 months are blocked and this block updates on VRS daily e.g. with tickets (for this CL one) 121763 and 121783 overnight tonight (note the 1 hour difference between these two updates). I've tested this by blocking a couple of nights at CL: I blocked 1-3 March 2020 as unavailable on Airbnb, and it reported as: BEGIN:VEVENTDTEND;VALUE=DATE:20200303DTSTART;VALUE=DATE:20200301UID:6fec1092d3fa-dbee66b864684ee7510511bbbd25020e@airbnb.comSUMMARY:Airbnb (Not available)END:VEVENT(However, the new event has not been saved to the VRS calendar, as per bugnote713. Also, I shall unblock those dates now that I've tested it.) So I think that this shows that Airbnb have changed how they report their calendars. In the past only Airbnb bookings came through to us. Now any blocked dates come through to us, including 2 nights a year in advance.I'm surprised that setting the VRS app to only look 360 days ahead doesn't solve the problem for 12months hence, but perhaps you could set the calendars so that they ignore those blocks so that the dates remain free and no ticket is generated.Hope this info is helpfulMartin","No image","No file"

The site needs a lot of development to stay relevant. That will take time - time I frankly don't have. So I have made a tough decision: Over the coming months, BugNotes will disappear from the internet and become a private tool just for me. Don’t worry - there will be time to react. But in the end, you will need to migrate to another service. If you need to migrate or save your data, look here for details.
